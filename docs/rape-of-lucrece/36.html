<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<p>This stanza from Shakespeare's <em>The Rape of Lucrece</em> describes Tarquin's internal conflict before raping Lucrece, focusing on the battle between his conscience and his desires. Let's break it down line by line:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"Thus, graceless, holds he disputation / 'Tween frozen conscience and hot-burning will,"</strong>  This sets the scene.  "Thus" refers to the preceding events, showing the progression of Tarquin's descent. "Graceless" immediately establishes Tarquin's moral failing.  He engages in a "disputation" ‚Äì a debate ‚Äì between two opposing forces within himself: a "frozen conscience" (a cold, inactive, perhaps weak sense of morality) and a "hot-burning will" (a powerful, passionate desire, fueled by lust).  The imagery of "frozen" versus "hot-burning" creates a stark contrast highlighting the intensity of his internal struggle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"And with good thoughts make dispensation, / Urging the worser sense for vantage still;"</strong> Here, Tarquin actively manipulates his own moral compass. He grants himself "dispensation" (permission) from good thoughts, allowing them to be overridden. He "urges the worser sense" (his lustful desires) "for vantage still," meaning he consistently uses his base desires to gain an advantage, justifying his actions, even if only to himself. This reveals a cunning and manipulative aspect to his character.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Which in a moment doth confound and kill / All pure effects, and doth so far proceed,"</strong> The "which" refers to the prioritizing of his lust. The effect of this is swift and destructive: his base desires ("worser sense") "confound and kill" all pure effects ‚Äì destroying any positive consequences or virtue he might have had.  The action progresses rapidly and drastically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"That what is vile shows like a virtuous deed."</strong> This is the culmination of the stanza's argument. Tarquin's self-deception is so complete that his vile act (rape) appears, in his mind, to be a virtuous deed. This highlights the power of self-justification and the dangerous potential of unchecked desire.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Literary Devices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personification:</strong>  "Frozen conscience" and "hot-burning will" are abstract concepts given human-like qualities.</li>
<li><strong>Antithesis:</strong> The opposition between "frozen conscience" and "hot-burning will" creates a powerful contrast.  Also, "good thoughts" versus "worser sense" establishes a clear dichotomy.</li>
<li><strong>Imagery:</strong>  The vivid imagery of "frozen" and "hot-burning" creates a visceral sense of the conflict within Tarquin.</li>
<li><strong>Paradox:</strong> The final line presents a paradox: something inherently vile is made to seem virtuous. This reflects the twisted nature of Tarquin's justifications.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Meaning:</strong></p>
<p>The stanza vividly depicts Tarquin's moral collapse. He doesn't simply succumb to his lust; he actively rationalizes and justifies his actions, ultimately twisting his perception of right and wrong. The internal struggle is not a battle between good and evil, but rather a manipulation of his conscience to allow his base desires to prevail, demonstrating the insidious nature of self-deception and the ease with which one can rationalize immoral behavior.  It foreshadows the heinous act to come and highlights the psychological complexity of the villain.</p>
