        <h1>Stanza 59 - Explanation</h1>
<h2>Original Stanza</h2>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Her breasts, like ivory globes circled with blue,
A pair of maiden worlds unconquered,
Save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew,
And him by oath they truly honoured.
These worlds in Tarquin new ambition bred;
Who, like a foul ursurper, went about
From this fair throne to heave the owner out.
</code></pre></div>

<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>Line-by-Line Breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"Her breasts, like ivory globes circled with blue,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Her breasts:</strong> Refers to Lucrece's breasts, the subject of the description.</li>
<li><strong>like ivory globes:</strong> This is a <strong>simile</strong>. The whiteness and smooth, spherical shape of her breasts are compared to polished ivory globes. This suggests purity, preciousness, and a sense of idealized beauty.</li>
<li><strong>circled with blue:</strong> This refers to the visible blue veins beneath the skin, a sign of delicate skin and innocence. The "blue" also connects to the idea of royalty, adding another layer of meaning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"A pair of maiden worlds unconquered,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A pair:</strong> Referring again to her breasts.</li>
<li><strong>maiden worlds unconquered:</strong> This is a <strong>metaphor</strong>. Her breasts are likened to uncharted, pristine worlds. "Maiden" emphasizes her virginity and purity. "Unconquered" suggests they are untouched, inviolate, and represent a realm of innocence that has not been corrupted.</li>
<li>This line elevates the description from simple physical details to a symbolic representation of Lucrece's purity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Save of their lord:</strong> Her husband, Collatinus.</li>
<li><strong>no bearing yoke they knew:</strong> "Bearing yoke" is a <strong>metaphor</strong> for the sexual submission expected in marriage. They haven't yet experienced the "yoke" of conjugal duty.</li>
<li>This line emphasizes Lucrece's loyalty and fidelity to her husband. While she is married, her breasts (and, by extension, her sexuality) remain dedicated solely to him.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"And him by oath they truly honoured."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>And him by oath:</strong> Again, referring to her husband, Collatinus.</li>
<li><strong>they truly honoured:</strong> She is bound to him by a sacred vow (oath) of marriage, and she is faithful and devoted.</li>
<li>This line further underscores her commitment to her marital vows and her virtuous nature.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"These worlds in Tarquin new ambition bred;"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>These worlds:</strong> Refers back to Lucrece's breasts as "maiden worlds unconquered."</li>
<li><strong>in Tarquin new ambition bred:</strong> The sight of Lucrece's beauty and purity ignites a desire in Tarquin that transcends mere lust. It's an ambition to conquer, to defile, to possess something that is rightfully Collatinus's.</li>
<li>This line marks the turning point. The sight of Lucrece's purity doesn't inspire him; it incites his lust for power and domination.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Who, like a foul usurper, went about"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Who:</strong> Refers to Tarquin.</li>
<li><strong>like a foul usurper:</strong> This is a <strong>simile</strong>. Tarquin's impending actions are compared to a tyrant who illegally and unjustly seizes a throne. "Foul" emphasizes the depravity and injustice of his intent.</li>
<li>This line explicitly links Tarquin's lust to a desire for power and control, turning his intentions into a political act of usurpation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"From this fair throne to heave the owner out."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>this fair throne:</strong> Lucrece, and by extension, her virtue and her body. This is a <strong>metaphor</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>to heave the owner out:</strong> To violently displace Collatinus, the rightful possessor of Lucrece.</li>
<li>This line emphasizes the violent and unjust nature of Tarquin's planned assault. He's not simply seeking pleasure; he's attempting to dethrone the rightful owner of Lucrece's virtue and purity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Meaning:</strong></p>
<p>This stanza is a pivotal point in the poem. It vividly describes Lucrece's beauty and, more importantly, her virtue and fidelity to her husband. Her breasts, depicted as ivory globes and "maiden worlds unconquered," symbolize her purity and untouched nature. However, this very purity becomes the catalyst for Tarquin's lust. The sight of her inspires in him a desire to conquer and defile, transforming him into a "foul usurper" seeking to overthrow the rightful owner (Collatinus) from his "fair throne" (Lucrece).</p>
<p>The stanza expertly uses vivid imagery, similes, and metaphors to elevate the depiction of Lucrece from mere physical beauty to a symbol of virtue and purity. It also foreshadows the tragic events to come, as Tarquin's "new ambition" sets the stage for his violent assault and Lucrece's eventual suicide. The language of usurpation and power highlights the political dimension of the rape, emphasizing the poem's broader themes of tyranny, injustice, and the abuse of power.</p>
