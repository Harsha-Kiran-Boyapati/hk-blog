<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<p>This stanza from Shakespeare's <em>The Rape of Lucrece</em> sets the scene and establishes the tragic irony that will unfold. Let's break it down line by line:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"For he the night before, in Tarquin's tent,"</strong> This sets the context.  "He" refers to Collatinus, Lucrece's husband. The location, "Tarquin's tent," implies a military setting, highlighting the power and authority of Tarquin, setting the stage for the later violation of Lucrece.  The preposition "For" suggests a causal relationship with the following lines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Unlock'd the treasure of his happy state;"</strong>  This is a metaphor. Collatinus "unlocked" the "treasure" of his happiness, suggesting the revelation or full appreciation of his good fortune. "Happy state" refers to his marriage to Lucrece.  The verb "unlocked" suggests a hidden, precious quality that was previously unappreciated or fully realized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"What priceless wealth the heavens had him lent / In the possession of his beauteous mate;"</strong> This continues the metaphor, emphasizing the exceptional value of his wife.  "Priceless wealth" and "beauteous mate" highlight Lucrece's beauty and the immense value Collatinus places on her.  The phrasing "heavens had him lent" suggests a divine gift, emphasizing the seemingly perfect and blessed nature of his marriage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Reckoning his fortune at such high-proud rate,"</strong> This line describes Collatinus's immense pride and satisfaction in his wife. "Reckoning his fortune" means he assessed and valued his life's blessings. "High-proud rate" signifies an overestimation, foreshadowing the coming tragedy. This is a hint of hubris.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"That kings might be espoused to more fame, / But king nor peer to such a peerless dame."</strong>  This uses a comparison (antithesis) to further emphasize Lucrece's exceptional qualities. Kings might have greater fame and power, but no one, not even a king or nobleman ("peer"), possesses a wife as extraordinary as Lucrece ("peerless dame"). This is hyperbole, obviously exaggerating Lucrece's virtues to show the depth of Collatinus's love and the magnitude of the loss to come.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Literary Devices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Metaphor:</strong> The comparison of Lucrece to "priceless wealth" and Collatinus's happiness to a "treasure" is a central metaphor.</li>
<li><strong>Hyperbole:</strong> The exaggeration of Lucrece's beauty and virtue ("peerless dame") emphasizes her exceptional qualities and foreshadows the devastating impact of her rape.</li>
<li><strong>Antithesis:</strong> The contrasting phrases "more fame" and "such a peerless dame" highlight the different aspects of value, showing how Collatinus prioritizes Lucrece's unique qualities over worldly power and fame.</li>
<li><strong>Personification:</strong> The heavens are personified as lending Collatinus a gift.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Meaning:</strong></p>
<p>This stanza paints a picture of idyllic marital bliss. Collatinus, having just spent the night with Lucrece, fully appreciates the extraordinary value of his wife, considering her far superior to any other woman, even surpassing the wives of kings and nobles. This profound happiness, however, is presented with a bittersweet irony. Shakespeare subtly hints at the fragility of this happiness and the impending tragedy, foreshadowing the rape of Lucrece and the devastation that will follow. The emphasis on Collatinus's pride and the extreme value he places on Lucrece creates a powerful contrast to the horrific events that will soon follow, intensifying the impact of the rape.  The stanza sets the stage for the destruction of this idyllic scene and highlights the devastating consequences of Tarquin's actions.</p>
