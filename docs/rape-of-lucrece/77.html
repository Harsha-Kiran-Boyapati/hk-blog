<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>Breakdown of each line:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>'Then, for thy husband and thy children's sake,'</strong> - This line sets up the persuasive appeal. Tarquin is imploring Lucrece to consider the well-being of her family: her husband, Collatinus, and her potential children. He's attempting to make her feel responsible for protecting their reputation and future. This is an appeal to <em>duty</em> and <em>maternal instinct</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>'Tender my suit: bequeath not to their lot'</strong> - Here, "Tender my suit" is a euphemism for "Grant my desire," which is to sleep with her. "Bequeath not to their lot" means "do not leave as an inheritance to them" or "do not cause them to suffer." This is a crucial part of his manipulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>'The shame that from them no device can take,'</strong> - This line speaks about the lasting nature of the shame he threatens to bring upon them. "Device" here refers to any strategy, plan, or remedy. He argues that this shame is inescapable and permanent. This plays on Lucrece's fear of <em>dishonor</em> and <em>social stigma</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>'The blemish that will never be forgot;'</strong> - Reinforces the idea that the shame will be indelible. The word "blemish" suggests something impure, disfiguring, and unforgettable. It emphasizes the long-lasting consequences of her perceived transgression. Note the <em>repetition</em> of the concept of lasting shame from the previous line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>'Worse than a slavish wipe or birth-hour's blot:'</strong> - Provides an analogy to clarify the severity of the threatened shame. "Slavish wipe" could refer to a mark of servitude or a brand that identifies someone as a slave, while a "birth-hour's blot" is a birthmark. Tarquin is implying that the shame he threatens to bring is <em>worse</em> than these pre-existing, visible flaws that are beyond a person's control. This is an example of <em>simile</em> (using "worse than"). It's also worth noting the <em>alliteration</em> on "birth-hour's blot."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>'For marks descried in men's nativity'</strong> - Introduces the rationale behind the analogy. "Marks descried in men's nativity" means birthmarks or inherent traits observable at birth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>'Are nature's faults, not their own infamy.'</strong> - This line concludes the comparison. Birthmarks are "nature's faults," not the individual's fault, therefore they don't bring infamy or dishonor. He's contrasting these innate marks (birthmarks, etc.) with the shame of adultery, which he is framing as a conscious choice Lucrece can prevent. The <em>contrast</em> serves to emphasize how much <em>worse</em> the shame he's threatening is, as it would be perceived as her own doing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Literary Devices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Euphemism:</strong> "Tender my suit"</li>
<li><strong>Appeal to Ethos/Pathos:</strong> He tries to manipulate Lucrece by invoking her family's honor (ethos) and inciting fear and empathy (pathos).</li>
<li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Of the concept of enduring shame.</li>
<li><strong>Simile:</strong> "Worse than a slavish wipe or birth-hour's blot."</li>
<li><strong>Alliteration:</strong> "Birth-hour's blot"</li>
<li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Between birthmarks (nature's faults) and the shame he's threatening (perceived as Lucrece's choice).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Meaning:</strong></p>
<p>In this stanza, Tarquin uses carefully crafted arguments to pressure Lucrece into submitting to his desires. He appeals to her sense of responsibility towards her husband and children, arguing that the shame that would result from her refusal is far worse than any innate flaw or mark of fate. He attempts to minimize his own responsibility by suggesting that Lucrece has the power to prevent this dishonor, thus placing the burden of choice ‚Äì and the blame ‚Äì squarely on her shoulders. The stanza hinges on a false equivalence: birthmarks are not a source of shame because they are not a person's fault, whereas adultery would be perceived as Lucrece's choice, thus making it a much greater source of "infamy." In essence, Tarquin is trying to guilt and manipulate Lucrece into believing that she is responsible for her family's honor and that succumbing to his advances is the only way to preserve it.</p>
