<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>Line-by-Line Breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 1: "Look, as the fair and fiery-pointed sun,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Look, as..."</strong>: This is an imperative, a command to the reader to pay attention to the comparison that will follow. It immediately draws the reader into the scene.</li>
<li><strong>"fair and fiery-pointed sun"</strong>:  This describes the sun using vivid imagery. "Fair" suggests beauty, brightness, perhaps even justice. "Fiery-pointed" emphasizes the sun's intense heat and the piercing nature of its rays.  <strong>Alliteration</strong> is present in "fiery-pointed". The sun is a powerful and majestic force.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 2: "Rushing from forth a cloud, bereaves our sight;"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Rushing from forth a cloud"</strong>: The sun is presented as bursting out suddenly and powerfully. "Forth" is an archaic form of "from," adding a sense of formality.</li>
<li><strong>"bereaves our sight"</strong>: The sudden emergence of the sun overwhelms the viewer's eyes, causing a temporary loss of vision.  "Bereaves" suggests a loss or deprivation, even if temporary. It highlights the sun's overwhelming power.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 3: "Even so, the curtain drawn, his eyes begun"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Even so"</strong>: Connects the image of the sun to the scene at hand, indicating a direct comparison.</li>
<li><strong>"the curtain drawn"</strong>: This refers to the curtains around Lucrece's bed being pulled back, revealing her.</li>
<li><strong>"his eyes begun"</strong>:  "His" refers to Tarquin. He is now seeing Lucrece for the first time (or perhaps more completely) as the curtains are drawn.  The word "begun" subtly hints at the ongoing action and Tarquin's escalating desire.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 4: "To wink, being blinded with a greater light:"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"To wink"</strong>:  Tarquin's eyes are closing or squinting involuntarily.</li>
<li><strong>"being blinded with a greater light"</strong>: The cause of Tarquin's winking. This "greater light" is Lucrece's beauty and virtue, which is overpowering and disorienting to Tarquin. This line is a metaphor. Lucrece's beauty and purity are the 'light'.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 5: "Whether it is that she reflects so bright,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Whether it is that she reflects so bright"</strong>: This line introduces a question about the source of the light.  "Reflects so bright" suggests that Lucrece is radiating beauty and virtue, like a mirror reflecting light.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 6: "That dazzleth them, or else some shame supposed;"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"That dazzleth them"</strong>: Her beauty and virtue are overwhelming and blinding to Tarquin.</li>
<li><strong>"or else some shame supposed"</strong>: An alternative explanation. Perhaps Tarquin's reaction is caused by a subconscious sense of shame or guilt that he feels at the thought of violating her virtue. "Supposed" suggests that this shame might not be fully conscious.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 7: "But blind they are, and keep themselves enclosed."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"But blind they are"</strong>: Reinforces the idea that Tarquin's eyes are metaphorically blinded. He is either overwhelmed by Lucrece's beauty or by his own suppressed shame.</li>
<li><strong>"and keep themselves enclosed"</strong>: Implies that Tarquin's eyes remain closed, either literally or figuratively.  They are "enclosed" because he's turning inward, shutting out the light, and succumbing to his lustful impulses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Meaning and Literary Devices:</strong></p>
<p>This stanza compares the effect of Lucrece's beauty and virtue on Tarquin to the blinding effect of the sun emerging from behind a cloud. Shakespeare uses the powerful image of the sun to convey the overwhelming impact of Lucrece's presence.</p>
<p>The stanza explores the psychological impact of beauty and the conflict between lust and conscience. It suggests that Lucrece's virtue acts as a kind of moral "light" that blinds Tarquin, forcing him to turn away. The ambiguity of whether the "blindness" is caused by her beauty or his own shame highlights the internal struggle that Tarquin is experiencing.</p>
<p><strong>Key Literary Devices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simile:</strong> The entire stanza revolves around a simile. Tarquin's reaction to Lucrece is <em>like</em> the effect of the sun on one's eyes. ("Look, as...")</li>
<li><strong>Metaphor:</strong> Lucrece's beauty and virtue are presented as a "light" that can "blind."</li>
<li><strong>Imagery:</strong> The stanza is rich in visual imagery, particularly the description of the sun and its fiery rays.</li>
<li><strong>Alliteration:</strong> "Fair and fiery-pointed" emphasizes the intensity of the sun.</li>
<li><strong>Ambiguity:</strong> Shakespeare intentionally leaves it unclear whether the "blindness" is due to Lucrece's beauty or Tarquin's shame, adding complexity to the characterization.</li>
<li><strong>Personification:</strong> While not direct, the sun is treated with a certain agency, "rushing from forth a cloud" as if with purpose.</li>
<li><strong>Foreshadowing:</strong>  The "blindness" can be seen as foreshadowing the moral blindness that leads Tarquin to commit the rape.</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, this stanza is a crucial moment in the narrative, showing the power of Lucrece's virtue and the internal conflict that is consuming Tarquin as he prepares to violate it. The vivid imagery and careful use of literary devices create a powerful and unsettling effect on the reader.</p>
