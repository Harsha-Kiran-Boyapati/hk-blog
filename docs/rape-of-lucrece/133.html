<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<p>Okay, let's break down stanza 133 of Shakespeare's <em>The Rape of Lucrece</em> line by line and then consider the overall meaning:</p>
<p><strong>Line-by-Line Breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>'Mis-shapen Time, copesmate of ugly Night,'</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mis-shapen Time:</strong> Time is personified and described as deformed or distorted, suggesting it is not functioning as it should. The term "mis-shapen" also hints at the destructive and negative aspect of Time.</li>
<li><strong>Copesmate of ugly Night:</strong> "Copesmate" means companion or partner. Time is linked to the "ugly Night," further emphasizing its association with darkness, evil, and hidden deeds (like the rape that happened during the night). This creates a powerful image of a destructive partnership.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Personification:</strong> Time is given human characteristics.</li>
<li><strong>Metaphor:</strong> Time is being compared to something else.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>'Swift subtle post, carrier of grisly care,'</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Swift subtle post:</strong> Time is a messenger ("post") that is both quick and sly. It is swift because time passes quickly, but also subtle in its effects, often going unnoticed as it brings about decay and change.</li>
<li><strong>Carrier of grisly care:</strong> Time brings "grisly care," which is terrible worry, sorrow, and suffering. It emphasizes the pain and negative experiences time delivers.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Metaphor:</strong> Time is compared to a messenger/post.</li>
<li><strong>Alliteration:</strong> "Swift subtle".</li>
<li><strong>Assonance:</strong> "grisly" and "care".</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>'Eater of youth, false slave to false delight,'</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eater of youth:</strong> A powerful image of time consuming and destroying beauty and vigor. It connects to the idea of aging, decay, and the loss of what is precious.</li>
<li><strong>False slave to false delight:</strong> Time seems to serve "false delight" (deceptive pleasure or temporary joy), but is actually a "false slave," meaning it's not truly controlled by pleasure, but rather deceives and is destructive. In other words, Time allows for these fleeting pleasures, but ultimately those pleasures lead to greater pain and regret.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Metaphor:</strong> Time is a consumer and a slave.</li>
<li><strong>Alliteration:</strong> "False slave" and "false delight".</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>'Base watch of woes, sin's pack-horse, virtue's snare;'</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Base watch of woes:</strong> "Base" suggests something low, contemptible, or ignoble. Time is described as a lowly observer or guardian of suffering and sorrow. It allows the "woes" to accumulate and take their toll.</li>
<li><strong>Sin's pack-horse:</strong> Time carries the burden of sin, enabling it to spread and endure. It emphasizes time's role in allowing evil to flourish.</li>
<li><strong>Virtue's snare:</strong> Time can trap virtue, leading to its downfall. Suggests that even the virtuous are not immune to the corrosive effects of time and the temptations that arise within it. It reinforces the idea that even good qualities can be exploited or destroyed.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Metaphor:</strong> Time is a watch, a pack-horse and a snare.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>'Thou nursest all and murder'st all that are:'</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thou nursest all and murder'st all that are:</strong> This line encapsulates the dual nature of time. It gives life and fosters growth ("nurst"), but ultimately destroys everything ("murder'st"). This highlights the tragic, inevitable cycle of creation and destruction that time governs.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Device:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Paradox:</strong> Time nurtures and murders.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>'O, hear me then, injurious, shifting Time!'</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>O, hear me then, injurious, shifting Time!:</strong> This is a direct address to time. "Injurious" means harmful or damaging. "Shifting" suggests time is fickle, unreliable, or always changing. Lucrece is pleading with time, acknowledging its power and its capacity for harm.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Apostrophe:</strong> Addressing an inanimate object.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>'Be guilty of my death, since of my crime.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be guilty of my death, since of my crime:</strong> Here, Lucrece declares that Time should be blamed for her death, because it is also responsible for her "crime" (not her sin, but the rape she endured). She believes time is a force that enabled and perpetuated the evil that led to her downfall. It implies the events transpired because of the corrupting and destructive power of time.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Paradox:</strong> Asking time to be guilty</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Meaning:</strong></p>
<p>In this stanza, Lucrece delivers a powerful denunciation of Time. She sees it not as a neutral force but as a destructive entity that collaborates with darkness and evil. Time is portrayed as responsible for aging, suffering, the spread of sin, and ultimately, her own tragedy. She calls upon Time to be held accountable for her death, as it enabled and perpetuated the crime that led to her despair. The stanza reflects a deep sense of helplessness and a recognition of the overwhelming power of Time to corrupt and destroy even the most virtuous. It's a bleak and despairing perspective, highlighting the tragic implications of the events that have befallen Lucrece. She doesn't see Time as a healer, but as an accomplice in the evil that has ruined her life. She asks that if Time enabled the crime, it should take responsibility for the fallout which is her suicide.</p>
