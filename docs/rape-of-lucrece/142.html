        <h1>Stanza 142 - Explanation</h1>
<h2>Original Stanza</h2>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>&#39;Let him have time to see his friends his foes,
And merry fools to mock at him resort;
Let him have time to mark how slow time goes
In time of sorrow, and how swift and short
His time of folly and his time of sport;
And ever let his unrecalling crime
Have time to wail th&#39; abusing of his time.
</code></pre></div>

<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<p>Okay, let's break down this stanza from Shakespeare's <em>The Rape of Lucrece</em> line by line, identify the literary devices, and then discuss its overall meaning.</p>
<p><strong>Line-by-Line Breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"Let him have time to see his friends his foes,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Breakdown:</strong>  This line implores that Tarquin should be given ample time to distinguish between true friends and enemies.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong>  <em>Alliteration</em> (repetition of the "f" sound in "friends" and "foes") emphasizes the contrast between the two groups.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"And merry fools to mock at him resort;"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Breakdown:</strong> This line suggests that Tarquin should be subject to ridicule and derision from foolish, light-hearted people. "Resort" means they should come to him for this purpose.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> <em>Irony</em> (these 'fools' are wise enough to mock him)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Let him have time to mark how slow time goes"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Breakdown:</strong>  This introduces a key concept: Tarquin should experience the agonizing slowness of time when in sorrow.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> None in particular. The line relies on the inherent understanding of how time feels when you are unhappy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"In time of sorrow, and how swift and short"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Breakdown:</strong>  This line directly contrasts the slow passage of time in sorrow with the rapid passage of time when indulging in pleasure or foolishness.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> <em>Juxtaposition/Contrast</em> (between "slow time" in sorrow and "swift and short" time in folly).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"His time of folly and his time of sport;"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Breakdown:</strong> This amplifies that idea: Tarquin should have the chance to see how quickly his pleasurable moments vanished.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> <em>Parallelism</em> (using the same grammatical structure "His time of...") for emphasis. <em>Repetition</em> of "time"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"And ever let his unrecalling crime"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Breakdown:</strong>  This means Tarquin's crime, which he cannot undo or take back, must always weigh on him. "Unrecalling" means irreversible.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> None in particular</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Have time to wail th' abusing of his time."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Breakdown:</strong> Finally, Tarquin should have all the time in the world to lament (wail) the way he misused his time and life through his actions.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> <em>Irony</em> (Time is a thing he has abused and yet now it is the cause of his punishment). <em>Alliteration</em> (the "t" sound in "time to" and "th") connects time to his punishment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Meaning and Interpretation:</strong></p>
<p>The stanza is a powerful curse, or a desire for just retribution, levied against Tarquin (implied to be coming from a figure such as Lucrece's husband or father).  It's not simply a wish for his death, but a much more elaborate and psychologically torturous fate.  The idea is that Tarquin should live with the <em>consequences</em> of his actions, and those consequences should be drawn out and excruciating.</p>
<p>The stanza focuses heavily on the concept of <em>time</em>. The repetition of the word "time" emphasizes its importance. The desire is that he be forced to <em>feel</em> the weight of his crime.</p>
<ul>
<li>He should realize the true nature of the people around him (friends vs. enemies).</li>
<li>He should be humiliated and mocked.</li>
<li>He should experience the slow agony of sorrow and regret, contrasting sharply with the fleeting pleasure he sought in his crime.</li>
<li>He should be forever haunted by the irreversible nature of his actions.</li>
<li>He should spend an eternity regretting his misuse of time and his life.</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, the stanza desires that Tarquin's life be a living hell, a constant reminder of his transgression. The emphasis on "time" suggests a prolonged period of suffering, a punishment far worse than a swift death. The stanza is a complex blend of justice, revenge, and moral condemnation. It is a wish that Tarquin live long enough to fully comprehend the gravity of his crime and to suffer the full consequences.</p>
