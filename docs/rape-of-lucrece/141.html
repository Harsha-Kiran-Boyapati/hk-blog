        <h1>Stanza 141 - Explanation</h1>
<h2>Original Stanza</h2>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>&#39;Let him have time to tear his curled hair,
Let him have time against himself to rave,
Let him have time of Time&#39;s help to despair,
Let him have time to live a loathed slave,
Let him have time a beggar&#39;s orts to crave,
And time to see one that by alms doth live
Disdain to him disdained scraps to give.
</code></pre></div>

<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<p>Okay, let's break down Stanza 141 of Shakespeare's <em>The Rape of Lucrece</em> line by line and then discuss the overall meaning and literary devices.</p>
<p><strong>Line-by-Line Breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"Let him have time to tear his curled hair,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong>  Allow Tarquin (the "him" being referred to here) the opportunity to express his anguish through physical violence against himself. Tearing his hair is a sign of extreme grief, regret, and self-hatred. The 'curled hair' adds to the imagery of his vanity which he now turns upon himself in self-harm.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> <em>Imagery</em>, evoking a vivid picture of a man in torment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Let him have time against himself to rave,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Let Tarquin have the chance to curse and denounce himself in a state of frenzied madness. "Rave" suggests uncontrolled, irrational speech driven by intense emotion. He has time to turn his wrath on himself.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> <em>Imagery</em>, reinforcing the chaotic and destructive nature of his guilt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Let him have time of Time's help to despair,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Let Tarquin experience a slow and agonizing realization that even the passage of time will not alleviate his despair. This is a very bleak and potent line, implying that his guilt will be a constant companion throughout his life. There is no hope that time will make his pain more bearable.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> <em>Personification</em> (Time is given the ability to help), <em>Paradox</em> (Time is typically seen as a healer, but here it only deepens despair), <em>Alliteration</em> ('time' repeated).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Let him have time to live a loathed slave,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Let him endure a life of servitude and hatred, both from himself and others. He will be a slave to his guilt, and despised by society.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> <em>Metaphor</em> (Tarquin is not literally a slave, but his guilt makes him one)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Let him have time a beggar's orts to crave,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Allow him the time to be reduced to begging for scraps (orts) like a common pauper. This depicts his complete downfall from nobility and power to utter destitution.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> <em>Imagery</em>, painting a picture of abject poverty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"And time to see one that by alms doth live,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong>  And give him the time to see someone who lives solely on charity. This is setting up a stark contrast.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> N/A</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Disdain to him disdained scraps to give."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Let him have the time to be refused even the scraps that a beggar living off of alms would scorn to give. This is the ultimate humiliation.  He is lower than the lowest.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> <em>Irony</em>, the one-time ruler reduced to a state where even a beggar looks down upon him; <em>Repetition</em> ("disdain" and "disdained") emphasizes the utter contempt he will face.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Meaning of the Stanza:</strong></p>
<p>This stanza is a powerful and vengeful curse placed upon Tarquin, presumably by the speaker (Lucrece herself or someone acting on her behalf, like Collatine or Brutus). It outlines a prolonged, torturous, and utterly humiliating fate for him as punishment for his crime. The key element is the repetition of "Let him have time..." which creates a relentless rhythm and underscores the idea that Tarquin's suffering will be extended over a long period. The stanza emphasizes that Tarquin will not only experience physical and emotional pain, but also social degradation and complete loss of status. He will be utterly alone and despised, even by those who are themselves at the bottom of society. It represents a desire for absolute and complete retribution, ensuring that Tarquin suffers a fate far worse than death.</p>
<p><strong>Key Literary Devices Summary:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Imagery:</strong> Vivid descriptions that create a strong emotional impact (tearing hair, raving, begging for scraps).</li>
<li><strong>Personification:</strong> "Time's help" gives time human-like qualities.</li>
<li><strong>Paradox:</strong> Time, usually a healer, here intensifies despair.</li>
<li><strong>Alliteration:</strong> "Time" repeated.</li>
<li><strong>Metaphor:</strong> Tarquin as a "loathed slave" (not literally, but in terms of his guilt).</li>
<li><strong>Irony:</strong> A former nobleman being scorned by a beggar.</li>
<li><strong>Repetition:</strong> "Let him have time..." emphasizes the relentless nature of the curse.</li>
<li><strong>Anaphora:</strong> The repetition of the phrase "Let him have time" at the beginning of each line.</li>
</ul>
<p>This stanza is a masterful example of Shakespeare's ability to create a vivid and emotionally charged portrayal of revenge and despair, using language rich in imagery and rhetorical devices.</p>
