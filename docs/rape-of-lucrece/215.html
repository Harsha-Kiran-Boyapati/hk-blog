        <h1>Stanza 215 - Explanation</h1>
<h2>Original Stanza</h2>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>She throws her eyes about the painting round,
And who she finds forlorn she doth lament.
At last she sees a wretched image bound,
That piteous looks to Phrygian shepherds lent.
His face, though full of cares, yet showed content;
Onward to Troy with the blunt swains he goes,
So mild, that patience seemed to scorn his woes.

<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<p>Okay, let's break down Stanza 215 of Shakespeare's <em>The Rape of Lucrece</em> line by line, identify the literary devices, and then give an overall interpretation of the stanza within the context of the poem.</p>
<p><strong>Line-by-Line Breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"She throws her eyes about the painting round,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Lucrece is frantically looking around at the artwork that is decorating the room where she was raped.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> <em>Alliteration</em> with "about" and "about"; <em>Visual imagery</em> - we can picture her frantic gaze.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"And who she finds forlorn she doth lament."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> She feels sympathy for the figures in the painting that appear sad and despondent. She identifies with their sorrow.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> <em>Empathy</em> - shows Lucrece's sensitive and compassionate nature.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"At last she sees a wretched image bound,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Finally, her attention is drawn to a specific picture of a miserable figure who is tied up (bound).</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> <em>Suspense</em> - the word "At last" makes the reader wonder who it is she sees. <em>Visual Imagery</em> - The image of someone bound evokes feelings of powerlessness and entrapment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"That piteous looks to Phrygian shepherds lent."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> This figure is depicted with a pitiful expression that is directed towards the Trojan (Phrygian) shepherds.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> <em>Allusion</em> - The mention of Phrygian shepherds is an allusion to the story of Paris, who was raised as a shepherd but was really a prince of Troy. <em>Imagery</em> - "Piteous looks" further reinforces the emotion of the scene.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"His face, though full of cares, yet showed content;"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Despite the anxiety and suffering evident in his face, he seems to be at peace or resigned to his fate. This is a crucial point, as it seems contradictory.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> <em>Paradox/Oxymoron</em> - The combination of "full of cares" and "showed content" is paradoxical; they are contrasting elements. This highlights the character's inner strength and resilience (or perhaps resignation).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Onward to Troy with the blunt swains he goes,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> He is headed toward Troy with the simple (blunt) shepherds.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> <em>Visual Imagery</em> - we can picture the journey to Troy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"So mild, that patience seemed to scorn his woes."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> He is so gentle and accepting of his suffering that even patience itself seems to think he is not bothered by it. He endures with such tranquility.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> <em>Personification</em> - "Patience" is given a human attribute (scorn). <em>Hyperbole</em> - The exaggeration that "patience seemed to scorn his woes" emphasizes his extraordinary level of endurance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Meaning of the Stanza:</strong></p>
<p>This stanza describes Lucrece's attempt to distract herself from her trauma by observing a painting. The image she fixates on is that of Paris being led to Troy. Paris is shown with a face full of cares yet also displaying content, suggesting he accepts his fate. The image of Paris, a prince raised as a shepherd, going to Troy despite his implied knowledge of the doom that awaits his city, offers a parallel to Lucrece's own situation. She, too, is a victim facing an impossible situation, grappling with pain and a sense of impending doom.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Significance of Paris:</strong> The allusion to Paris is significant because his actions ultimately led to the Trojan War and the destruction of Troy. By focusing on Paris, Shakespeare is suggesting that Lucrece is also at the center of a tragic event, one with potentially devastating consequences. The "cares" on Paris' face may be anticipation of that future suffering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lucrece's Identification:</strong>  Lucrece identifies with Paris's suffering and perhaps sees in him a model of how to face her own ordeal ‚Äì with a kind of stoic acceptance, even though she's deeply affected. The stanza suggests that Lucrece might strive to emulate this character's ability to endure hardship with a semblance of serenity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Foreshadowing:</strong> The focus on a character associated with the fall of Troy may also foreshadow Lucrece's own tragic end and the turmoil that will erupt as a result of her rape.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, this stanza offers a brief respite from the intense emotional turmoil of Lucrece, but it also serves to deepen the tragic mood and foreshadow the devastating events to come. The image of Paris functions as a mirror reflecting Lucrece's own predicament and providing her (and the reader) with a glimpse of the qualities needed to endure such a profound crisis.</p>
