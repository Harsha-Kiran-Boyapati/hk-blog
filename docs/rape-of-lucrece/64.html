<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>Line-by-Line Breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"They, mustering to the quiet cabinet"</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>They</strong>: Refers to Lucrece's servants/attendants (we know from earlier stanzas that she woke them after the rape).</li>
<li><strong>Mustering</strong>: Implies a gathering, a coming together with purpose. It suggests a sense of urgency and collective action, but also perhaps a lack of discipline (they are "mustering" not marching, connoting the chaos).</li>
<li><strong>Quiet cabinet</strong>: A private room or chamber, a place of refuge or intimacy. The word "cabinet" is important, underscoring the enclosed and personal nature of the space, which is now being violated by the traumatic intrusion.</li>
<li><strong>Overall</strong>: The servants are gathering quickly and in a disorganized manner at Lucrece's private chamber.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Where their dear governess and lady lies"</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Where</strong>: Connects this line directly to the previous one, explaining the location of the "quiet cabinet."</li>
<li><strong>Dear governess and lady</strong>: Lucrece.  The use of both terms ("governess" perhaps implying a more formal role than just "lady") reinforces her social status and the respect she commands. "Dear" shows their affection for her.</li>
<li><strong>Lies</strong>: Resting, reposing. It's a loaded word. It could imply rest or sickness, but given the context, it foreshadows her upcoming death, where she will literally lie.</li>
<li><strong>Overall</strong>: This line establishes that Lucrece is in her chamber, resting, and emphasizes her position of authority and the affection the servants hold for her.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Do tell her she is dreadfully beset"</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do tell</strong>: Simple verb, conveying the direct and urgent nature of their communication.</li>
<li><strong>Dreadfully beset</strong>: "Beset" means surrounded or attacked from all sides. "Dreadfully" intensifies the feeling of extreme peril.  This is a euphemism; they are telling her she is in terrible danger, though they may not fully know the extent of the horror she has endured.</li>
<li><strong>Overall</strong>: The servants inform Lucrece that she is in a terrible and dangerous situation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"And fright her with confusion of their cries"</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fright her</strong>: They scare Lucrece. The simplicity of this verb emphasizes the immediate impact of their actions.</li>
<li><strong>Confusion of their cries</strong>: The chaotic and overwhelming nature of their distressed voices. It highlights their panic and fear.</li>
<li><strong>Overall</strong>: The servants further terrify Lucrece with their noisy and disorganized cries, adding to the overall sense of chaos.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"She, much amazed, breaks ope her lock'd-up eyes"</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>She</strong>: Refers to Lucrece.</li>
<li><strong>Much amazed</strong>: Greatly surprised and bewildered.</li>
<li><strong>Breaks ope her lock'd-up eyes</strong>: A powerful metaphor.  Her eyes were "locked up" either because she was resting or, more likely, because she was trying to block out the horrific memory of the rape. "Breaks ope" suggests a violent and forceful awakening.  This "breaking" mirrors the violation she has endured.</li>
<li><strong>Overall</strong>: Lucrece, startled and confused, forcibly opens her eyes, breaking free from her slumber or her attempt to shut out the reality of what happened.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Who, peeping forth this tumult to behold"</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Who</strong>: Refers back to her eyes (personification).</li>
<li><strong>Peeping forth</strong>: Hesitant and fearful looking.</li>
<li><strong>This tumult to behold</strong>: To see the chaos and confusion. "Tumult" emphasizes the disorderly and agitated state of the scene.</li>
<li><strong>Overall</strong>: Her eyes cautiously peer out at the chaotic scene around her. This line continues the personification of her eyes, treating them as separate entities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Are by his flaming torch dimm'd and controll'd."</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Are by his flaming torch</strong>: Refers to Collatine's (Lucrece's husband) torch. This is the first mention of Collatine, who is the one holding the torch.</li>
<li><strong>Dimm'd and controll'd</strong>: Her eyes are overwhelmed and dominated by the light of the torch. "Dimm'd" suggests that her vision is impaired, perhaps a metaphor for her understanding of the situation being obscured. "Controll'd" implies that the torch (and, by extension, Collatine and the male world) is now dictating her experience.</li>
<li><strong>Overall</strong>: Her eyes, still fragile and vulnerable, are overwhelmed by the brightness of Collatine's torch, symbolizing the male dominance and the controlling force of the outside world intruding upon her trauma.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Meaning and Literary Devices:</strong></p>
<p>This stanza depicts the immediate aftermath of the rape, focusing on Lucrece's disturbed awakening and the intrusion of the outside world into her private space and personal trauma.  It highlights the chaos, fear, and vulnerability surrounding her.</p>
<p><strong>Key Literary Devices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personification:</strong> Lucrece's eyes are given human qualities ("peeping forth").</li>
<li><strong>Metaphor:</strong> "Breaks ope her lock'd-up eyes" is a powerful metaphor for her forceful awakening and the shattering of her inner peace. The "locked-up eyes" likely also allude to the idea that she is trying to block out the memory of the rape.</li>
<li><strong>Euphemism:</strong> "Dreadfully beset" is a mild term for the severity of Lucrece's situation.</li>
<li><strong>Imagery:</strong> The stanza is full of vivid imagery, such as the "quiet cabinet," "flaming torch," and "confusion of their cries," which create a strong sense of the scene.</li>
<li><strong>Foreshadowing:</strong> "Lies" has multiple connotations and foreshadows Lucrece's death.</li>
<li><strong>Juxtaposition:</strong> The "quiet cabinet" juxtaposed with the "confusion of their cries" emphasizes the disruption of her peace.</li>
<li><strong>Symbolism:</strong> The torch is a symbol of male power and the controlling force of the outside world intruding upon Lucrece's trauma.</li>
<li><strong>Alliteration:</strong> The repetition of "D" in "dreadfully beset" helps emphasize the terror of the situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, the stanza effectively portrays the moment when Lucrece is forced to confront the horror of her rape. The disruption of her private space, the chaotic cries of her servants, and the overwhelming presence of the torch all contribute to the sense of her loss of control and the beginning of her tragic downfall. The use of "dimmed and controlled" also alludes to her loss of agency and the beginning of a new period controlled by the patriarchal society.</p>
