<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<p>This stanza from Shakespeare's <em>The Rape of Lucrece</em> depicts Lucrece's initial interaction with Tarquin, before the rape itself.  Let's break it down line by line:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"Quoth he, 'She took me kindly by the hand,"</strong>  This line introduces Tarquin's perspective (indicated by "Quoth he," an archaic form of "said he"). It sets a seemingly innocent and courteous tone, as Lucrece welcomes him with a friendly gesture. This is ironic foreshadowing, as we know Tarquin's true intentions are far from kind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"And gazed for tidings in my eager eyes,"</strong>  Lucrece's gaze is described as searching for news ("tidings") in Tarquin's eyes.  "Eager eyes" suggests anticipation and perhaps a degree of anxiety, reflecting her concern for her husband's safety.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Fearing some hard news from the warlike band,"</strong> This line reveals the source of Lucrece's anxiety: she's worried about her husband, Collatinus, who's away at war ("warlike band").  The phrase "hard news" implies bad or devastating news, setting a tone of apprehension.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Where her beloved Collatinus lies."</strong>  This line reinforces Lucrece's love and concern for her husband, emphasizing her vulnerability and dependence on him.  The word "lies" is subtly ambiguous; it can mean both "rests" (as in sleeping) and "is situated/located," adding to the suspense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"O, how her fear did make her colour rise!"</strong> This exclamation marks a shift in focus from dialogue to Lucrece's physical reaction.  Her fear manifests as a change in her complexion, demonstrating the intensity of her emotional state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"First red as roses that on lawn we lay,"</strong>  This line uses a <strong>simile</strong> to describe the initial flush of her fear. Her face turns red, compared to the vibrant red of roses resting on a green lawn. The image is visually striking and emphasizes the beauty of Lucrece even in her distress.  The use of "we lay" is a subtle poetic license, personifying the roses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Then white as lawn, the roses took away."</strong>  This line continues the simile, showing the rapid change in her complexion. As her fear intensifies, the redness fades, leaving her pale as the lawn itself, suggesting faintness or near-collapse.  The phrase "the roses took away" is a powerful <strong>metaphor</strong>, implying the fear has drained the colour from her face, leaving her drained and vulnerable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Meaning:</strong></p>
<p>This stanza masterfully establishes the deceptive calm before the storm.  While presenting a seemingly innocent encounter, it subtly hints at the underlying tension and vulnerability of Lucrece's situation.  Through imagery, simile, metaphor, and carefully chosen words, Shakespeare creates a sense of foreboding, preparing the reader for the horrific events to come.  The description of Lucrece's fluctuating complexion, mirroring the fragility of her emotional state, highlights her innocence and her impending doom at the hands of Tarquin.  The contrast between the initial courteous interaction and Lucrece's internal fear underscores the deceptive nature of Tarquin's charm and foreshadows the violence to follow.</p>
