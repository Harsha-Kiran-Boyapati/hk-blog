<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<p>Okay, let's break down stanza 106 of <em>The Rape of Lucrece</em> line by line and then look at the overall meaning and literary devices:</p>
<p><strong>Line-by-Line Breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 1: "He like a thievish dog creeps sadly thence;"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"He"</strong>:  Refers to Tarquin, the rapist.</li>
<li><strong>"like a thievish dog"</strong>:  A <strong>simile</strong> comparing Tarquin to a dog that has stolen something and feels shame or fear of being caught.  The "thievish dog" emphasizes his guilt and the base, animalistic nature of his actions.  He sees himself as pathetic.</li>
<li><strong>"creeps sadly thence"</strong>:  Suggests he is moving slowly, dejectedly, and dishonorably <em>away</em> from Lucrece. "Thence" is an archaic term meaning "from there." His sadness is probably due to the guilt he is feeling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 2: "She like a wearied lamb lies panting there;"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"She"</strong>: Refers to Lucrece, the victim.</li>
<li><strong>"like a wearied lamb"</strong>:  Another <strong>simile</strong>. This image paints Lucrece as innocent, vulnerable, and exhausted after the violent act. A lamb is a common symbol of purity and gentleness. The term "wearied" suggests she is extremely exhausted from the ordeal.</li>
<li><strong>"lies panting there"</strong>:  Indicates her physical and emotional distress. The "panting" suggests rapid, shallow breathing due to shock, fear, or physical struggle. "There" is used to highlight the place in which she was wronged and is still suffering.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 3: "He scowls and hates himself for his offence;"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"He scowls"</strong>: Suggests anger and displeasure, now directed inward at himself.</li>
<li><strong>"hates himself for his offence"</strong>:  Reveals the beginning of his internal conflict and guilt. He now recognises the horror of what he has done.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 4: "She, desperate, with her nails her flesh doth tear;"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"She, desperate"</strong>:  Highlights her complete despair and loss of hope.</li>
<li><strong>"with her nails her flesh doth tear"</strong>:  Illustrates her self-inflicted pain and anguish. It is a physical manifestation of her emotional torment. "Doth tear" is an archaic way of saying "tears", showing a more extreme version of the action.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 5: "He faintly flies, sneaking with guilty fear;"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"He faintly flies"</strong>: Shows his reluctance to take action, he is hesitant.</li>
<li><strong>"sneaking with guilty fear"</strong>: This further reinforces the image of him as cowardly and ashamed. He is not facing the consequences, but running away.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 6: "She stays, exclaiming on the direful night;"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"She stays"</strong>: Contrasts with Tarquin's flight.  She is rooted to the spot, unable to escape the trauma.</li>
<li><strong>"exclaiming on the direful night"</strong>:  She is lamenting and cursing the terrible night, the time of her rape. "Direful" emphasizes the horror and tragedy of the event.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 7: "He runs, and chides his vanish'd, loathed delight."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"He runs"</strong>:  Further emphasizes his escape and avoidance of responsibility.</li>
<li><strong>"chides his vanish'd, loathed delight"</strong>:  He is scolding or rebuking his past pleasure, which is now gone and replaced with self-disgust.  The "vanish'd, loathed delight" suggests he initially saw the act as pleasurable, but now recognizes it as vile and disgusting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Meaning:</strong></p>
<p>This stanza powerfully contrasts the immediate aftermath of the rape for both Tarquin and Lucrece.  Tarquin is consumed by guilt and flees the scene, his initial "delight" replaced by self-loathing. He wants to forget it happened and move on. Lucrece, on the other hand, is trapped in her trauma, overwhelmed by despair and self-inflicted pain.  The stanza highlights the asymmetry of the experience: Tarquin can <em>run</em> from his crime, but Lucrece is bound to the place and memory of her violation.  It shows the immediate physical and emotional responses of both the perpetrator and the victim.</p>
<p><strong>Literary Devices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simile:</strong>  The prominent use of similes ("like a thievish dog," "like a wearied lamb") creates vivid and contrasting images of the two characters. These similes emphasize their respective states of mind and moral standing.</li>
<li><strong>Juxtaposition/Contrast:</strong> The stanza is built on a stark contrast between Tarquin's actions and Lucrece's reactions. His "creeping" and "flying" are set against her "staying." His "scowling and hating" are mirrored by her "desperation" and self-harm.</li>
<li><strong>Alliteration:</strong> The use of alliteration in "direful delight" further enhances the description of the scene.</li>
<li><strong>Imagery:</strong>  The stanza is full of powerful visual imagery: the "thievish dog," the "wearied lamb," the tearing of flesh, the guilty flight.</li>
<li><strong>Internal Conflict:</strong> The stanza reveals Tarquin's internal conflict, showcasing his feelings of guilt and self-loathing. Lucrece also experiences internal conflict, which is shown through her self-harming actions.</li>
<li><strong>Archaic language:</strong> The use of "thence" and "doth tear" adds to the formal, classical tone of the poem.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, stanza 106 is a crucial moment in <em>The Rape of Lucrece</em> that emphasizes the immediate consequences of the crime and sets the stage for the tragic events that follow. It uses powerful imagery, contrasting characterizations, and literary devices to convey the profound impact of the rape on both the perpetrator and the victim.</p>
