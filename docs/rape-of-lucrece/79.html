<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>Line Breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"But when a black-faced cloud the world doth threat,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> This line introduces a dark and ominous image. A "black-faced cloud" is a metaphor for impending danger, trouble, or evil. The phrase "doth threat" emphasizes the menacing nature of this situation. The world is at risk.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Personification:</strong> The cloud is given a "face" and the ability to "threaten," attributing human-like qualities to it.</li>
<li><strong>Metaphor:</strong> The cloud acts as a representation of a threat to the 'world'.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"In his dim mist the aspiring mountains hiding,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> The "dim mist" refers to the dark cloud's obscurity. "Aspiring mountains" likely symbolize virtue, honor, or stability. The mist hides them, suggesting that the danger obscures or corrupts these positive qualities.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Imagery:</strong> Creates a visual image of obscured and immense mountains due to mist.</li>
<li><strong>Metaphor:</strong> Mountains are metaphorically representative of something of importance, likely of virtue and stability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"From earth's dark womb some gentle gust doth get,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> This line introduces a counterforce. A "gentle gust" (a light breeze) arises from "earth's dark womb." The "dark womb" suggests the origin of this gust is a hidden or unexpected source, perhaps even the potential for good within a flawed world.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Imagery:</strong> Contrast with the prior imagery, suggesting something gentle is emerging from the 'dark womb' of the earth.</li>
<li><strong>Metaphor:</strong> The "earth's dark womb" is metaphorically representative of the source of a new change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Which blows these pitchy vapours from their bidding,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> The gentle gust is strong enough to push the "pitchy vapours" (the dark, heavy clouds) away from their intended purpose or direction ("their bidding"). The threat is being averted, at least temporarily.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Metaphor:</strong> "Pitchy vapours" are a metaphor for the threat to the world introduced in the first line.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Hindering their present fall by this dividing;"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> The gust prevents the immediate downfall that the dark clouds were threatening. It achieves this by separating and dispersing them.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Imagery:</strong> the vapours are being divided and halted from falling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"So his unhallow'd haste her words delays,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> This line applies the earlier imagery to the situation in the poem, the rape of Lucrece. "His unhallow'd haste" refers to Tarquin's lustful rush towards his goal (raping Lucrece). "Her words delays" refers to how her arguments are delaying his actions. The breeze delaying the clouds is a metaphor for her resistance delaying his attack.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Analogy:</strong> The previous lines are used as an analogy to Tarquin's actions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"And moody Pluto winks while Orpheus plays."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> This line adds a layer of classical allusion. Pluto is the god of the underworld, often associated with darkness and evil. Orpheus, a legendary musician, was known for his ability to charm even the most formidable figures with his music. "Moody Pluto winks" suggests that even the forces of darkness are momentarily swayed or distracted by the power of art/persuasion, albeit with a hint of disapproval.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Allusion:</strong> To Greek mythology (Pluto and Orpheus).</li>
<li><strong>Juxtaposition:</strong> Pluto represents darkness and Orpheus represents light and beauty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Meaning:</strong></p>
<p>The stanza uses an extended metaphor to describe the conflict between Tarquin's lust and Lucrece's resistance. The opening lines establish the threat of darkness and danger. A glimmer of hope then emerges through the "gentle gust," which represents Lucrece's attempts to reason with Tarquin and delay his attack. This effort is enough to temporarily hinder his progress. The final line emphasizes that even the forces of evil (Pluto) are momentarily affected by the power of beauty and persuasion (Orpheus), though ultimately darkness will prevail.</p>
<p><strong>Key Themes and Ideas:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Power of Resistance: Lucrece's words, like the gust of wind, offer a temporary reprieve from the impending doom.</li>
<li>The Conflict Between Light and Darkness: The stanza presents a struggle between good and evil, represented by the contrasting images of light and darkness, and by the allusions to Pluto and Orpheus.</li>
<li>The Nature of Persuasion: Orpheus's music suggests that even evil can be swayed, though perhaps not completely overcome, by the power of art and reason.</li>
<li>The Inevitability of Tragedy: While there's a moment of delay, the ominous opening and the mention of Pluto hint that the tragedy is ultimately inevitable.</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, this stanza offers a moment of hope and resistance within a narrative headed towards tragedy. It is a beautiful piece of writing filled with literary devices that convey meaning.</p>
