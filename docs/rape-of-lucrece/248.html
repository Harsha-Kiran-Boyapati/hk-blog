        <h1>Stanza 248 - Explanation</h1>
<h2>Original Stanza</h2>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Stone-still, astonished with this deadly deed,
Stood Collatine and all his lordly crew,
Till Lucrece‚Äô father that beholds her bleed,
Himself on her self-slaughtered body threw,
And from the purple fountain Brutus drew
The murd‚Äôrous knife, and, as it left the place,
Her blood, in poor revenge, held it in chase;
</code></pre></div>

<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<p>Let's break down this powerful stanza from Shakespeare's <em>The Rape of Lucrece</em>:</p>
<p><strong>1. "Stone-still, astonished with this deadly deed,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Stone-still"</strong>:  A simile, comparing the men to statues, emphasizing their utter lack of movement. This highlights their shock and paralysis.</li>
<li><strong>"astonished"</strong>:  Means extremely surprised and horrified.</li>
<li><strong>"this deadly deed"</strong>:  Refers to Lucrece's suicide, the act of self-slaughter.</li>
<li><strong>Overall:</strong> The initial reaction of the men present (Collatine and his crew) is one of frozen, dumbfounded horror. They are unable to process what has just happened.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. "Stood Collatine and all his lordly crew,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Collatine"</strong>: Lucrece's husband.</li>
<li><strong>"lordly crew"</strong>: The other noblemen who accompanied Collatine.</li>
<li><strong>Overall:</strong> Simply states who is present and reinforces their stunned state.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. "Till Lucrece‚Äô father that beholds her bleed,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Lucrece's father"</strong>:  Her father, a prominent man in their society, likely a senator or a high-ranking official.</li>
<li><strong>"beholds her bleed"</strong>: Sees the blood flowing from her self-inflicted wound, highlighting the visual horror of the scene.</li>
<li><strong>Overall:</strong> Introduces Lucrece's father, and emphasizes the devastating impact of seeing his daughter's blood.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. "Himself on her self-slaughtered body threw,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Himself...threw"</strong>: Indicates that her father collapses, possibly in grief or to hold her.</li>
<li><strong>"self-slaughtered body"</strong>:  A direct and stark description of Lucrece, emphasizing her suicide.</li>
<li><strong>Overall:</strong> Depicts the father's grief and physical response to his daughter's death.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. "And from the purple fountain Brutus drew"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Brutus"</strong>:  Lucius Junius Brutus, a key figure in the overthrow of the Tarquins and the founding of the Roman Republic.</li>
<li><strong>"purple fountain"</strong>: This is a metaphor for Lucrece's blood, the color linking it to royalty and nobility. The wound gushing with blood is described as a fountain.</li>
<li><strong>"drew"</strong>: Brutus likely takes the knife from Lucrece's body.</li>
<li><strong>Overall:</strong> Brutus now takes action. The blood evokes a sense of beauty and destruction, indicating her high social status and the violence that is being inflicted.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. "The murd‚Äôrous knife, and, as it left the place,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"murd'rous knife"</strong>:  An example of personification, as the knife is given the attribute of killing.</li>
<li><strong>"as it left the place"</strong>: Emphasizes the instant reaction of blood.</li>
<li><strong>Overall:</strong> Describes Brutus taking the knife from her body.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. "Her blood, in poor revenge, held it in chase;"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Her blood... held it in chase"</strong>: Personification. The blood is depicted as actively pursuing the knife, almost as if the blood wants revenge on the instrument of death.</li>
<li><strong>"poor revenge"</strong>: The revenge of blood is futile, since Lucrece is already dead. It underscores the tragedy and the pointlessness of her death.</li>
<li><strong>Overall:</strong> The blood seems to be actively seeking vengeance on the knife. It also indicates an overwhelming of blood and suffering.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Meaning:</strong></p>
<p>This stanza is a vivid portrayal of the immediate aftermath of Lucrece's suicide. The men are initially paralyzed by shock. We see the raw grief of her father, and Brutus begins to take control of the situation by removing the knife, perhaps as a symbol of taking action to seek justice. The overwhelming bloodshed is described in vivid detail, as Shakespeare uses metaphors and personification to emphasize the tragedy and the futility of revenge at this moment. The stanza sets the scene for Brutus's decision to avenge Lucrece and rouse the Romans against the Tarquins, which is a key turning point in the poem.</p>
<p><strong>Key Literary Devices:</strong></p>
