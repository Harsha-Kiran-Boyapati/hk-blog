<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<p>This stanza from Shakespeare's <em>The Rape of Lucrece</em> explores Tarquin's internal struggle as he contemplates raping Lucrece. Let's break down each line:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"Why hunt I then for colour or excuses?"</strong>: This opens with a rhetorical question.  Tarquin acknowledges his internal debate and the futility of searching for justifications ("colour" meaning pretext or plausible reason) for his actions. He's already decided, but a flicker of doubt or guilt is present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"All orators are dumb when beauty pleadeth;"</strong>:  This is a hyperbole and personification.  "Orators" represent reason and logic, rendered speechless ("dumb") by Lucrece's beauty.  Beauty is personified as having such power that it silences rational argument.  This suggests Tarquin's lust overrides his better judgment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Poor wretches have remorse in poor abuses;"</strong>: This line is somewhat ambiguous.  "Poor wretches" could refer to Tarquin himself, acknowledging his own potential for regret ("remorse") after committing a "poor abuse" (a wretched act). Alternatively, it could refer to others who have committed similar acts, implying that even those who act badly might feel remorse. The word "poor" is used ironically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Love thrives not in the heart that shadows dreadeth:"</strong>:  This is a paradoxical statement.  Tarquin attempts to rationalize his actions by claiming true love ("Love") doesn't fear consequences ("shadows"). This is a clear self-deception; his "love" is clearly lust, not genuine affection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Affection is my captain, and he leadeth;"</strong>: This is a powerful metaphor.  "Affection," representing lust, is personified as a military commander ("captain") completely controlling Tarquin's actions.  He's surrendering his free will.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"And when his gaudy banner is display'd,"</strong>: The metaphor continues. "Affection's" "gaudy banner" represents the alluring and deceptive nature of lust, visually striking but ultimately leading to destruction.  "Gaudy" hints at its superficial attractiveness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"The coward fights and will not be dismay'd."</strong>: This is an oxymoron.  Tarquin, despite calling himself a "coward" for yielding to his base desires, ironically claims he will not be deterred.  He is a coward because he is not fighting his desires, but he also shows a false bravery in proceeding with his plan.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Meaning:</strong></p>
<p>The stanza reveals Tarquin's self-justification and rationalization before committing rape.  He tries to silence his conscience, using the power of Lucrece's beauty and the intoxicating force of lust to excuse his impending actions.  He uses military metaphors to portray himself as a soldier controlled by his desires, ultimately accepting his fate and rejecting moral reasoning. The stanza highlights the conflict between reason and passion, with passion winning decisively.  The literary devices employed ‚Äì hyperbole, personification, metaphor, paradox, and oxymoron ‚Äì serve to amplify the internal turmoil and the self-deception fueling Tarquin's descent into violence.</p>
