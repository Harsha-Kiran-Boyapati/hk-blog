<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<p>Okay, let's break down Stanza 121 from Shakespeare's <em>The Rape of Lucrece</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Line-by-Line Breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"Yet am I guilty of thy honour's wrack;"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"Yet": Indicates a continuation of thought, even a contradiction or twist on what came before.</li>
<li>"I": Lucrece is speaking (or, more accurately, her internal monologue is being presented).</li>
<li>"guilty of thy honour's wrack":  She feels responsible for the destruction ("wrack") of her husband's honor ("thy honour"). The word "wrack" suggests a violent shattering.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Device:</strong> <em>Alliteration</em>: The 'wr' sound emphasizes the violence and destruction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Yet for thy honour did I entertain him;"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"Yet": Again, a contrast.</li>
<li>"for thy honour":  Intended to uphold or show respect for her husband's honor.</li>
<li>"did I entertain him":  She offered Collatine's friend, Tarquin, hospitality as a guest.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Device:</strong> <em>Irony</em>: Her intention to protect her husband's honor is precisely what led to its destruction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Coming from thee, I could not put him back,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"Coming from thee":  Because Tarquin was a messenger or friend from her husband (Collatine).</li>
<li>"I could not put him back": She felt obliged to welcome him because of his connection to Collatine. She felt it would be rude to turn away someone he had sent.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Device:</strong> <em>Reason/Justification:</em> Lucrece explains why she allowed Tarquin to enter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"For it had been dishonour to disdain him:"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"For it had been dishonour":  It would have been considered impolite or a breach of hospitality to reject him.</li>
<li>"to disdain him": To reject or treat him with contempt.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Device:</strong> <em>Repetition/Parallelism</em>: Reinforces the importance of honor and appearance in the social context.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Besides, of weariness he did complain him,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"Besides": In addition to the obligation of hospitality.</li>
<li>"of weariness he did complain him": Tarquin claimed to be tired from his journey.  The archaic phrasing "complain him" suggests he was vocal about his exhaustion.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Device:</strong> <em>Characterization</em>: Shows Tarquin's manipulative behavior, using fatigue as a way to gain sympathy and entry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"And talk'd of virtue: O unlook'd-for evil,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"And talk'd of virtue": Tarquin deceptively spoke of virtuous principles and values.</li>
<li>"O unlook'd-for evil": An exclamation expressing her shock and horror at the unexpected turn of events.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Device:</strong> <em>Juxtaposition/Contrast</em>:  The contrast between Tarquin's words ("virtue") and his actions ("evil") highlights the hypocrisy and treachery of his character.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"When virtue is profaned in such a devil!"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"When virtue is profaned": When goodness is corrupted or desecrated.</li>
<li>"in such a devil!": By a person so evil and wicked (Tarquin).  Lucrece is condemning Tarquin as a demonic figure.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Device:</strong> <em>Metaphor</em>: Tarquin is likened to a "devil," emphasizing his inherent wickedness. <em>Exclamation</em>: Emphasizes Lucrece's horror.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Meaning:</strong></p>
<p>In this stanza, Lucrece is wrestling with her guilt and trying to understand how she became complicit in the events that led to her rape.  She justifies her initial actions ‚Äì entertaining Tarquin ‚Äì by emphasizing the importance of honor, hospitality, and social obligations. She believed she was acting virtuously by showing kindness to a guest who claimed to be a friend of her husband. However, she now realizes that Tarquin's outward display of virtue was a deceptive mask for his evil intentions. The stanza expresses Lucrece's horror and despair at the realization that her well-intentioned actions have been manipulated and that virtue itself has been profaned by Tarquin's wickedness. She sees Tarquin as a devil, highlighting the depth of his depravity.</p>
<p>The stanza showcases the dangers of misplaced trust and the devastating consequences that can arise when appearances are deceiving. Lucrece is trapped in a situation where adherence to social norms and expectations ultimately led to the violation of her own honor.</p>
