<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<p>This stanza from Shakespeare's <em>The Rape of Lucrece</em> explores Tarquin's internal conflict and justification for pursuing Lucrece. Let's break it down line by line:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"Shameful it is; ay, if the fact be known:"</strong>  Tarquin acknowledges the shamefulness of his intended actions.  The "fact" refers to his rape of Lucrece.  The conditional clause ("if the fact be known") shows he's aware of the social repercussions but prioritizes his desire.  The use of "ay" emphasizes his reluctant admission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Hateful it is; there is no hate in loving:"</strong> This is a paradoxical statement.  He attempts to rationalize his lust by claiming that genuine love cannot be hateful. This is a weak argument, as his actions are inherently disrespectful and violent.  The juxtaposition of "hateful" and "loving" highlights the internal conflict and the flawed logic he employs.  This is an example of <strong>antithesis</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"I'll beg her love; but she is own:"</strong>  He states his intention to "beg" Lucrece's love, a blatant underestimation of the situation.  "She is own" implies she's already married and therefore unattainable ‚Äì another obstacle he seemingly ignores. This shows his arrogance and disregard for her agency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"The worst is but denial and reproving:"</strong> He downplays the potential consequences.  He believes the worst outcome would be rejection ("denial") and criticism ("reproving"). This understates the gravity of his intended crime.  This line exhibits <strong>understatement</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"My will is strong, past reason's weak removing:"</strong> This is a powerful statement showcasing Tarquin's hubris.  He asserts his desire ("will") is stronger than reason, suggesting he's driven by passion rather than logic or morality.  This is a clear example of <strong>hyperbole</strong> (exaggeration of his will's strength) and <strong>personification</strong> (giving reason human qualities of weakness and ability to be removed).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Who fears a sentence or an old man's saw / Shall by a painted cloth be kept in awe."</strong> This is a proverb-like statement.  He dismisses the fear of punishment ("sentence") or conventional wisdom ("old man's saw"). He implies that anyone who hesitates due to such fears is easily intimidated ("kept in awe") by mere appearances ("painted cloth"). This uses <strong>metaphor</strong> (the "painted cloth" representing superficial threats) and <strong>synecdoche</strong> ("old man's saw" representing the wisdom of elders).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Meaning:</strong></p>
<p>This stanza reveals Tarquin's self-deceptive justifications for his planned rape.  He superficially acknowledges the shamefulness and potential consequences, but his unwavering desire, coupled with his arrogant dismissal of societal norms and moral considerations, drives him forward. He rationalizes his actions through flawed logic, highlighting his lack of empathy and respect for Lucrece's autonomy.  The stanza underscores the dangerous combination of powerful lust and a disregard for reason and morality.  The literary devices used emphasize the dramatic irony of Tarquin's self-delusion and the inevitability of his actions' tragic consequences.</p>
