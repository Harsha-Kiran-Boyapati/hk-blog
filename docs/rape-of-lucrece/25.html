        <h1>Stanza 25 - Explanation</h1>
<h2>Original Stanza</h2>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>And now this lustful lord leap&#39;d from his bed,
Throwing his mantle rudely o&#39;er his arm;
Is madly toss&#39;d between desire and dread;
Th&#39; one sweetly flatters, th&#39; other feareth harm;
But honest fear, bewitch&#39;d with lust&#39;s foul charm,
Doth too too oft betake him to retire,
Beaten away by brain-sick rude desire.

<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<p>This stanza from Shakespeare's <em>The Rape of Lucrece</em> depicts Tarquin's internal conflict as he wrestles with his lust for Lucrece. Let's break down each line:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"And now this lustful lord leap'd from his bed,"</strong>  This line sets the scene.  "Lustful lord" immediately establishes Tarquin's character and the nature of his action. The verb "leaped" suggests impulsive, uncontrolled action, emphasizing his overwhelming desire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Throwing his mantle rudely o'er his arm;"</strong> This detail adds to the sense of urgency and disarray. The "rudely" suggests a lack of decorum, further highlighting his uncontrolled state.  It's a physical manifestation of his inner turmoil.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Is madly toss'd between desire and dread;"</strong> This is the core of the stanza. Tarquin is presented as being "madly toss'd," a metaphor depicting his internal conflict between his overwhelming lust ("desire") and the potential consequences ("dread"). This uses the literary device of <strong>personification</strong>, giving human qualities to abstract concepts of desire and dread.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Th' one sweetly flatters, th' other feareth harm;"</strong> This line expands on the previous one, personifying desire and dread further.  Desire "sweetly flatters," highlighting its seductive power, while dread "feareth harm," showing its rational, cautionary nature.  The use of "sweetly" and "harm" creates a stark contrast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"But honest fear, bewitch'd with lust's foul charm,"</strong> Here, Shakespeare introduces a crucial element: "honest fear," representing Tarquin's conscience, is "bewitched" by lust.  This is a powerful <strong>metaphor</strong>, showing how lust overcomes even rational apprehension. "Lust's foul charm" emphasizes the corrupting nature of desire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Doth too too oft betake him to retire,"</strong>  "Honest fear" initially tries to make Tarquin retreat ("retire"). The repetition of "too" ("too too oft") emphasizes the frequency of this internal struggle and the weakness of his resolve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Beaten away by brain-sick rude desire."</strong> Ultimately, lust ("brain-sick rude desire") triumphs.  "Brain-sick" suggests a deranged mind, overwhelmed by passion. "Beaten away" uses violent imagery, signifying the complete domination of lust over reason and conscience.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Meaning:</strong></p>
<p>The stanza masterfully depicts the internal battle between Tarquin's lust and his conscience.  While he experiences fear and momentary hesitation, his lust ultimately overpowers his better judgment.  The imagery and personification highlight the seductive power of lust and its ability to corrupt even a seemingly rational individual.  The stanza foreshadows the tragic consequences of Tarquin's actions, emphasizing the destructive nature of unchecked desire.  It's a powerful psychological portrait demonstrating the internal conflict that leads to a morally reprehensible act.</p>
