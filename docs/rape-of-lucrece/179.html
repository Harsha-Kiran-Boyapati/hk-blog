        <h1>Stanza 179 - Explanation</h1>
<h2>Original Stanza</h2>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Their smoothness, like a goodly champaign plain,
Lays open all the little worms that creep;
In men, as in a rough-grown grove, remain
Cave-keeping evils that obscurely sleep:
Through crystal walls each little mote will peep:
Though men can cover crimes with bold stern looks,
Poor women&#39;s faces are their own fault&#39;s books.
</code></pre></div>

<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<p>Okay, let's break down stanza 179 of Shakespeare's <em>The Rape of Lucrece</em> line by line, identify literary devices, and then discuss the overall meaning.</p>
<p><strong>Line-by-Line Breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"Their smoothness, like a goodly champaign plain,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Their smoothness":</strong> Refers to the <em>surface</em> appearance of women (specifically here, the poem suggests it is physical appearance and the apparent "gentle" outward behaviour expected of them, particularly in contrast to men who are seen to have more "rough" outward behaviour)</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"like a goodly champaign plain":</strong> <em>Simile</em> comparing this surface smoothness to a beautiful, open, level field ("champaign"). A champaign plain is generally perceived as fair and open, without hiding places.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Meaning:</strong> This line establishes a superficial picture of women, suggesting they appear uncomplicated and without hidden depths (just as a plain is seen to be open and lacking hiding places). This is, however, immediately contradicted in the following lines.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Lays open all the little worms that creep;"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"little worms that creep":</strong> <em>Metaphor</em> for weaknesses, vulnerabilities, flaws, and perhaps even moral failings. These 'worms' are exposed and visible on the 'plain'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Meaning:</strong> This line argues that women's apparent "smoothness" makes their small flaws and faults highly visible and easily observed. Their faults and weaknesses are on display for all to see, just as worms are visible on the surface of a plain. The fact that they are "little" suggests that these flaws may be minor or insignificant, but because they are visible they are blown out of proportion, or open to exploitation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"In men, as in a rough-grown grove, remain"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"In men":</strong> Shifts the focus to the opposite sex</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"as in a rough-grown grove":</strong> <em>Simile</em> comparing men to a dense, overgrown forest or thicket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Meaning:</strong> In contrast to women, men are presented as being like a tangled forest. Their true nature is hidden within a dense, impenetrable exterior.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Cave-keeping evils that obscurely sleep:"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Cave-keeping evils":</strong> <em>Metaphor</em> for the vices, sins, and wicked thoughts that men harbor. The "cave" is a metaphor for the hidden depths of men's nature.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"obscurely sleep":</strong> Suggests that these evils are dormant, lurking, but not always apparent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Men's inner evils are kept hidden, like dangerous creatures sleeping in caves. Their rough exterior conceals these flaws, allowing them to remain unseen and undisturbed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Through crystal walls each little mote will peep:"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Through crystal walls":</strong> <em>Metaphor</em> for the clarity and transparency of women's outward appearance (the "smoothness" mentioned earlier).</li>
<li><strong>"each little mote":</strong> <em>Metaphor</em> for the smallest flaw or blemish. A "mote" is a tiny speck of dust.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"will peep":</strong> Suggests that even the smallest flaw is visible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Meaning:</strong> This line reinforces the idea that women's flaws, even the tiniest ones, are easily seen because their outward appearance is clear and transparent, like looking through crystal. This links back to the champaign plain.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Though men can cover crimes with bold stern looks,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"cover crimes":</strong> Direct reference to the wrongs men are capable of, but can hide.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"bold stern looks":</strong> Highlights the power and ability of men to hide their true nature through outward shows of dominance and strength.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Men can mask their wicked deeds and hide their true nature with their forceful and commanding demeanor. They are able to escape scrutiny.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Poor women's faces are their own fault's books."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Poor women's faces":</strong> Highlights the vulnerability and lack of power women possess in this society.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"their own fault's books":</strong> <em>Metaphor</em> comparing women's faces to open books that reveal their weaknesses and flaws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Meaning:</strong> In contrast to men, women's faces betray their flaws and make them vulnerable. Their faces serve as "books" that expose their faults, making them easy targets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Literary Devices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simile:</strong> Used to compare women's smoothness to a champaign plain and men to a rough-grown grove.</li>
<li><strong>Metaphor:</strong>  "Little worms" for flaws, "cave-keeping evils" for hidden vices, "crystal walls" for transparency, "their own fault's books" for revealing faces.</li>
<li><strong>Imagery:</strong> Strong visual imagery of plains, groves, caves, and crystal walls.</li>
<li><strong>Juxtaposition:</strong> The entire stanza relies on juxtaposing the perceived nature of women with the perceived nature of men, highlighting the differences in how they are viewed and judged.</li>
<li><strong>Irony:</strong> There is underlying irony throughout the stanza, as the supposed "smoothness" of women is ultimately presented as a weakness, while the "roughness" of men allows them to conceal their flaws.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Meaning:</strong></p>
<p>This stanza presents a critical commentary on the societal double standard applied to men and women. It argues that women's perceived "smoothness" and transparency make them vulnerable, as their flaws and weaknesses are easily seen and judged. In contrast, men's "roughness" and hidden nature allow them to conceal their vices and escape scrutiny. The stanza highlights the power dynamics that allow men to hide their crimes while women's faces betray their perceived faults, making them easy targets. The core idea is that outward appearances don't always reflect true character, and that societal expectations and power structures contribute to this discrepancy. The poem ultimately suggests that these unequal standards contribute to women's vulnerability and their susceptibility to exploitation, as is evidenced by the rape of Lucrece.</p>
