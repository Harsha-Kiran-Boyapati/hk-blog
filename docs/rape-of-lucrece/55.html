<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>Line-by-Line Breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Line 1: "O, had they in that darksome prison died!"</strong><ul>
<li><em>Meaning:</em> Oh, if only Tarquin and his men had died in that dark, wretched place (Lucrece's bedroom).</li>
<li><em>Literary Devices:</em><ul>
<li><strong>Exclamatory O:</strong> Conveys intense emotion, grief, and longing.</li>
<li><strong>"Darksome prison":</strong>  Metaphor. It refers to Lucrece's bedroom, which has become a place of torment and potential violation. The "darkness" suggests evil, secrecy, and the moral darkness of the act.</li>
<li><strong>Alliteration:</strong> "Darksome died" emphasizes the negativity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Line 2: "Then had they seen the period of their ill;"</strong><ul>
<li><em>Meaning:</em> Then, if they had died, their suffering (their "ill") would have come to an end.</li>
<li><em>Literary Devices:</em><ul>
<li><strong>"Period":</strong> Here, "period" means ending or conclusion. It has the additional, subtle connotation of a full stop on a sentence ‚Äì absolute finality.</li>
<li><strong>Irony:</strong> The line describes death as the "period of their ill," which is a common sentiment when discussing the end of suffering, but in this context, their death would have prevented the much greater ill of Lucrece's rape.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 3: "Then Collatine again, by Lucrece' side,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Meaning:</em> Then Collatine (Lucrece's husband) could have been with Lucrece again.</li>
<li><em>Literary Devices:</em><ul>
<li><strong>Idealized Image:</strong> Presents a picture of marital harmony, innocence, and peace.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 4: "In his clear bed might have reposed still:"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Meaning:</em> In their virtuous (clear) bed, they could have remained at peace.</li>
<li><em>Literary Devices:</em><ul>
<li><strong>"Clear bed":</strong>  Symbolism.  "Clear" represents purity, innocence, and the unblemished state of their marriage before the rape. It contrasts sharply with the moral corruption represented by Tarquin's actions.</li>
<li><strong>"Reposed still":</strong> Suggests serenity, tranquility, and the continuation of their idyllic life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 5: "But they must ope, this blessed league to kill;"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Meaning:</em> But they had to open the door (the attackers survived), which would destroy this blessed union (the marriage).</li>
<li><em>Literary Devices:</em><ul>
<li><strong>Dramatic Irony:</strong> The audience knows the consequences of opening the door. The opening of the door is an action, a decision that will lead to the destruction of something sacred.</li>
<li><strong>"Blessed league":</strong> Refers to the marriage; a sacred bond is about to be violated.</li>
<li><strong>Personification</strong> "they must ope, this blessed league to kill" The league (marriage) is being personified as something that can be killed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 6: "And holy-thoughted Lucrece to their sight"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Meaning:</em> And Lucrece, a woman of pure and virtuous thoughts, must be presented to their view.</li>
<li><em>Literary Devices:</em><ul>
<li><strong>Epithet:</strong> "Holy-thoughted Lucrece" is a descriptive phrase that emphasizes her virtuous nature. It serves to highlight the injustice of her fate.</li>
<li><strong>Foreshadowing</strong> The word sight means she will be on display to the attackers, which is not good.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 7: "Must sell her joy, her life, her world's delight."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Meaning:</em> Must forfeit her happiness, her life, and everything that makes the world beautiful (or "her world's delight").</li>
<li><em>Literary Devices:</em><ul>
<li><strong>Metaphor:</strong> "Sell her joy, her life, her world's delight" - Lucrece won't literally sell these things, but she will lose them due to the actions of Tarquin. "Sell" also suggests a sense of betrayal and loss of control. She is a victim.</li>
<li><strong>Climax:</strong> The line is the climax of the stanza, escalating the consequences. "Joy" is something personal, "life" is fundamental, and "world's delight" encompasses everything positive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Meaning:</strong></p>
<p>This stanza expresses the speaker's deep lament over the unfolding tragedy. It highlights the lost potential for happiness, marital harmony, and innocence had the villains died earlier. The focus then shifts to the inevitability of the rape and its devastating consequences for Lucrece, who will lose not only her happiness but also her life and her entire world as a result of this violation. The stanza builds a sense of dread and foreshadows the tragic events to come. The idealized language used to describe the marriage intensifies the horror of its impending destruction.</p>
