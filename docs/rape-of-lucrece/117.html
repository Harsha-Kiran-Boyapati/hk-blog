<h2>Original Stanza</h2>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>&#39;The nurse, to still her child, will tell my story,
And fright her crying babe with Tarquin&#39;s name;
The orator, to deck his oratory,
Will couple my reproach to Tarquin&#39;s shame;
Feast-finding minstrels, tuning my defame,
Will tie the hearers to attend each line,
How Tarquin wronged me, I Collatine.

<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<p>Okay, let's break down stanza 117 of Shakespeare's "The Rape of Lucrece," line by line, and then discuss the overall meaning and literary devices.</p>
<p><strong>Line-by-Line Breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"The nurse, to still her child, will tell my story,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Breakdown:</strong> The nurse, in an effort to quiet a crying baby, will recount Lucrece's tragic tale.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> This suggests Lucrece's story will become a common, cautionary tale, even used by nurses for disciplinary purposes. It highlights the widespread and long-lasting impact of the event.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"And fright her crying babe with Tarquin's name;"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Breakdown:</strong> The nurse will scare the baby by invoking Tarquin's name.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> This reinforces the idea that Tarquin's name will become synonymous with evil and terror. It shows the extreme negativity associated with his actions. We can also see that this could serve as an early kind of 'boogeyman' tale.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"The orator, to deck his oratory,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Breakdown:</strong> The public speaker, to embellish and improve his speech.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Orators, when giving speeches, will use Lucrece's story as an example in order to give weight to their arguments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Will couple my reproach to Tarquin's shame;"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Breakdown:</strong> Will link Lucrece's dishonor with Tarquin's disgrace.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> The orator will use the story to emphasize the contrast between Lucrece's innocence and Tarquin's guilt, highlighting the injustice she suffered. This implies Lucrece's story will be used as an example of injustice and virtue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Feast-finding minstrels, tuning my defame,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Breakdown:</strong> Minstrels (traveling singers/musicians) who seek out feasts and celebrations will create songs about Lucrece's dishonor. They are 'tuning' (arranging or creating) the story of her 'defame' (loss of reputation).</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> This emphasizes how Lucrece's story will be popularized and spread through entertainment. However, there's a subtle nuance: "tuning my defame" suggests the minstrels are not necessarily glorifying her, but rather using her tragedy for entertainment value. While spreading the story, they are still dealing with the 'defame' aspect - the damage to her reputation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Will tie the hearers to attend each line,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Breakdown:</strong> The minstrels' songs will captivate the audience and hold their attention on every word.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> This shows the powerful and engaging nature of the story. The audience will be drawn in and deeply affected by the tale of Lucrece. It also implies that the story has inherent dramatic appeal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"How Tarquin wronged me, I Collatine."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Breakdown:</strong> How Tarquin committed a wrong against me, Lucrece, wife of Collatine.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> This is a direct, simple statement that reinforces the personal aspect of the tragedy and identifies the victim and the perpetrator. The mention of "Collatine" connects her tragedy to her husband, and implies the damage and shame Tarquin has brought upon him too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Meaning:</strong></p>
<p>This stanza paints a picture of Lucrece's story becoming a widespread, legendary tale, used for moral instruction, political rhetoric, and entertainment. It emphasizes the enduring power of the story and the lasting impact of Tarquin's crime. Lucrece's name and story will become synonymous with innocence violated and injustice, while Tarquin's name will be associated with evil and shame. However, there's a subtle layer of complexity: the minstrels' "tuning my defame" suggests that, while the story is being spread, the focus may still be on her dishonor, even if indirectly. This acknowledges the complex and often unfair way women's stories, especially those involving sexual violence, are treated.</p>
<p><strong>Literary Devices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Foreshadowing:</strong> The entire stanza foreshadows the long-term consequences of Tarquin's actions and the enduring nature of Lucrece's story.</li>
<li><strong>Imagery:</strong> The stanza evokes vivid images: a crying baby being hushed, an orator passionately declaiming, minstrels singing to a captivated audience.</li>
<li><strong>Synecdoche:</strong> Perhaps "The nurse" could be seen as synecdoche, representing the wider female community who will perpetuate the story.</li>
<li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The stanza emphasizes the contrast between Lucrece's innocence and Tarquin's guilt, and between her reputation and his shame.</li>
<li><strong>Alliteration:</strong> "Feast-finding" uses alliteration to make that particular line more memorable.</li>
<li><strong>Irony:</strong> There's a degree of irony in the minstrels "tuning my defame." Lucrece is already defamed, yet the act of telling her story, even with good intentions, still risks focusing on that aspect.</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, this stanza highlights how Lucrece's personal tragedy transforms into a public and enduring narrative, shaping the moral and political landscape of Rome, but it does so with a nuanced acknowledgement of the potential for that narrative to perpetuate the very injustice it seeks to condemn.</p>
