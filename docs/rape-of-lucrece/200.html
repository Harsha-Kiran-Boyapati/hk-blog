<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<p>Okay, let's break down Stanza 200 of Shakespeare's <em>The Rape of Lucrece</em>, line by line, and then give an overall interpretation.</p>
<p><strong>Line-by-Line Breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"In Ajax and Ulysses, O, what art"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"In Ajax and Ulysses":</strong>  Establishes the subjects of the stanza: the Greek heroes Ajax (also known as Ajax the Great) and Ulysses (also known as Odysseus).  These are figures from the Trojan War, well-known for their contrasting personalities.</li>
<li><strong>"O, what art":</strong>  An exclamation expressing wonder and perhaps admiration (though possibly tinged with something else, as we'll see).  "Art" here refers to the skill or ability to discern character from appearance.  Shakespeare is suggesting that there's a clear and discernible skill at play in reading character.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Of physiognomy might one behold!"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Of physiognomy":</strong> Physiognomy is the (now largely discredited) practice of judging a person's character or personality from their outer appearance, especially their face.  This is the <em>art</em> that Shakespeare refers to in line 1.</li>
<li><strong>"might one behold!":</strong> A rhetorical question that is asking of the audience how obvious would the art of physiognomy be.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"The face of either ciphered either‚Äôs heart;"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"The face of either":</strong> Referring to the faces of Ajax and Ulysses respectively.</li>
<li><strong>"ciphered either's heart":</strong> This is the core of the stanza. "Ciphered" means "encoded" or "revealed".  The line states that each man's face held the <em>key</em> to unlocking their inner self (their heart = their character, their emotions, their intentions). The face served as a code or sign that revealed the man's true nature. Shakespeare uses <strong>metaphor</strong> here as face and heart are not literally ciphers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Their face their manners most expressly told."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Their face":</strong> Restates the emphasis on outward appearance.</li>
<li><strong>"their manners":</strong> Refers to their behavior, actions, and way of conducting themselves.</li>
<li><strong>"most expressly told":</strong> "Expressly" means clearly, directly, and unmistakably.  The face revealed their manners in a very clear way. This line reinforces the idea that their outward demeanor perfectly mirrored their inner character.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"In Ajax‚Äô eyes blunt rage and rigour rolled,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"In Ajax' eyes":</strong> Focus shifts to specific features.  The eyes are often considered the "windows to the soul."</li>
<li><strong>"blunt rage and rigour rolled":</strong> Describes Ajax's nature.  "Blunt rage" suggests unrefined, direct anger. "Rigour" indicates harshness, inflexibility, and severity.  The verb "rolled" implies that these qualities were not static but actively present and dynamic in his eyes. <strong>Alliteration</strong> on "rage" and "rigour" emphasises the intensity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"But the mild glance that sly Ulysses lent"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"But":</strong> A contrasting conjunction, signalling a shift to a different character.</li>
<li><strong>"the mild glance":</strong> Suggests gentleness, calmness, and perhaps even a deceptive innocence in Ulysses' gaze.</li>
<li><strong>"that sly Ulysses lent":</strong> The word "sly" immediately qualifies the "mild glance" with a hint of cunning and deceptiveness. The verb "lent" suggests the glance is something that is offered superficially, a constructed image rather than a genuine reflection of his character.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Showed deep regard and smiling government."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Showed deep regard":</strong>  Suggests a thoughtful, considered, perhaps even calculating attention. "Regard" here could mean consideration, but also a sense of control and command.</li>
<li><strong>"and smiling government":</strong> The phrase is more complex.  "Smiling" hints at diplomacy, charm, and perhaps manipulation.  "Government" suggests control, leadership, and the ability to rule (oneself and others).  The combination evokes a sense of calculated control masked by a pleasant exterior. The phrase 'smiling government' is an <strong>oxymoron</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Meaning and Literary Devices:</strong></p>
<p>The stanza argues that a person's character is clearly visible in their face, especially in their eyes. It uses the contrasting figures of Ajax and Ulysses to illustrate this point. Ajax, the warrior, is portrayed as straightforward and aggressive, his inner rage and harshness plain to see. Ulysses, the strategist, is portrayed as subtle and manipulative, hiding his cunning behind a facade of mildness and controlled authority.</p>
<p><strong>Key Literary Devices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Physiognomy:</strong> The underlying principle of reading character from appearance.</li>
<li><strong>Contrast:</strong>  The entire stanza is built on the contrast between Ajax and Ulysses.</li>
<li><strong>Imagery:</strong> Strong visual imagery is used to describe the eyes and facial expressions of each man ("blunt rage and rigour rolled," "mild glance," "smiling government").</li>
<li><strong>Metaphor:</strong> Face described as a cipher.</li>
<li><strong>Alliteration:</strong> "Rage and Rigour"</li>
<li><strong>Oxymoron:</strong> 'Smiling Government'</li>
<li><strong>Rhetorical Question:</strong> The question in lines 1 and 2 helps to engage the reader.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation in the Context of <em>The Rape of Lucrece</em></strong></p>
<p>In the context of the poem, this stanza serves as a commentary on the deceptive nature of appearances and the difficulty of judging character. Tarquin, the rapist, presents himself as a noble guest, but his true intentions are hidden.  The stanza raises questions about how well Lucrece (or anyone) can truly know another person and foreshadows the dangers of misjudging character based on outward appearances. The poem will then go on to show how flawed physiognomy is. It's also important to note that Ulysses, though portrayed as intelligent, is also "sly," hinting at a potential for deceit and moral ambiguity. This foreshadows the moral complexities that the poem explores.</p>
