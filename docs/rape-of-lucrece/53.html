<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 1: "Into the chamber wickedly he stalks,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Into the chamber"</strong>: Sets the scene; Collatine is now inside Lucrece's private bedroom.</li>
<li><strong>"wickedly"</strong>:  Immediately characterizes Collatine's action and intent as evil and immoral.</li>
<li><strong>"he stalks"</strong>: The verb "stalks" is significant.  It implies a predatory, hunting-like movement. It suggests Collatine is creeping and dangerous, and that Lucrece is the target of this pursuit.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Device:</strong>  The alliteration of "wickedly" and "walks" emphasizes the sinister nature of his entrance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 2: "And gazeth on her yet unstained bed."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"gazeth"</strong>:  Suggests a long, intense, and perhaps lustful look.</li>
<li><strong>"her yet unstained bed"</strong>:  The word "unstained" is crucial.  It highlights Lucrece's purity and innocence before Collatine's transgression.  The bed symbolizes her chastity and marital fidelity, which are about to be violated. It also creates dramatic irony, because the reader knows that will not be the case for long.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 3: "The curtains being close, about he walks,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"The curtains being close"</strong>: The closed curtains create a sense of secrecy and confinement. They emphasize the private nature of the space that Collatine is invading.</li>
<li><strong>"about he walks"</strong>: He is pacing and circling as he is building the nerve to commit the assault.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 4: "Rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head:"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head"</strong>:  This is a vivid and grotesque image. "Rolling" suggests uncontrolled lust and agitation. "Greedy eyeballs" connects his eyes to his avarice and desire.  It suggests he's consumed by his lust, and can't control his gaze.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Device:</strong>  The imagery here is striking and disturbing. It highlights the purely physical and predatory nature of his lust.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 5: "By their high treason is his heart misled;"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"By their high treason"</strong>: "Treason" is a powerful word, suggesting a betrayal of something sacred. Here, it refers to his eyes and their treacherous role in leading him astray. This also introduces the concept that Collatine's actions are a betrayal of the social order.</li>
<li><strong>"is his heart misled"</strong>:  He is trying to shift the blame, claiming his heart has been influenced.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 6: "Which gives the watch-word to his hand full soon"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Which gives the watch-word"</strong>: The word "watch-word" is interesting. This implies a command, as if his heart is ordering his hand to take action, as he is building the courage to commit the act.</li>
<li><strong>"to his hand full soon"</strong>:  Implies that the action will not be delayed much longer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 7: "To draw the cloud that hides the silver moon."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"To draw the cloud"</strong>: The "cloud" is a metaphor for the curtain, or a covering.</li>
<li><strong>"that hides the silver moon"</strong>: "Silver moon" is a metaphor for Lucrece, representing her purity, beauty, and chastity. The moon, being associated with Diana, the goddess of chastity, reinforces Lucrece's virtuous nature. Collatine pulling back the curtain is symbolic of him preparing to violate her.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Device:</strong>  The metaphor of the "silver moon" for Lucrece is beautiful yet unsettling in this context. It contrasts her purity with the impending darkness of Collatine's actions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Meaning of the Stanza:</strong></p>
<p>The stanza paints a picture of Collatine's escalating lust and intent as he enters Lucrece's chamber. Shakespeare emphasizes the predatory nature of his actions through vivid imagery and word choice. Collatine is not simply visiting; he is <em>stalking</em>. The "unstained bed" is a stark reminder of Lucrece's innocence, which is about to be shattered. The stanza highlights the internal conflict within Collatine, as he attempts to excuse his behavior by blaming his heart and eyes for misleading him. The final image of drawing back the "cloud" to reveal the "silver moon" foreshadows the impending violation of Lucrece's purity and the destruction of her chastity. The stanza is filled with dramatic tension, as the reader is aware of the impending tragedy and the inevitable loss of Lucrece's innocence.</p>
