<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<p>Okay, let's break down stanza 108 from Shakespeare's <em>The Rape of Lucrece</em>, line by line, then look at the overall meaning and literary devices.</p>
<p><strong>Line-by-Line Breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"They think not but that every eye can see"</strong>:  This line is a bit convoluted.  "Think not but that" is a double negative construction, meaning "They certainly think that". So, <em>they</em> (Lucrece is referring to Tarquin specifically, but also perhaps all perpetrators of similar crimes) believe that everyone is able to see...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"The same disgrace which they themselves behold;"</strong>: ...the same shame/dishonor/degradation/outrage that <em>they</em> (the rapists) themselves now perceive (presumably because of the guilt and potential consequences of their actions). The disgrace is both the <em>act</em> and its <em>consequences</em>. The rapist projects his own feelings of disgrace onto the victim, and believes it is now readily apparent to everyone else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"And therefore would they still in darkness be,"</strong>: Because they believe everyone can see their disgrace, they would prefer to stay in darkness. "Darkness" here is both literal (they'd prefer the crime remained secret, hidden) and figurative (they want to stay hidden from scrutiny, to avoid the consequences of their actions). Their preference is for secrecy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"To have their unseen sin remain untold;"</strong>:  This reinforces the previous line.  Their motivation for wanting to remain in darkness is so that their <em>unseen sin</em> (the rape itself, which they hope remains hidden) remains <em>untold</em> (undiscovered, unconfessed, not spoken of). The rhyme 'be' and 'see' is continued.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"For they their guilt with weeping will unfold,"</strong>: Here, the subject shifts. Lucrece turns her gaze to herself and her own response to the shame of the rape. This line means: because of them, she will be forced to "unfold" or reveal her own guilt (which is really shame and sorrow), through her own weeping and lamenting. The idea is that, because of their actions, she will inevitably have to reveal what happened, and she will do so with great sorrow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"And grave, like water that doth eat in steel,"</strong>: The act of unfolding guilt will <em>grave</em> this disgrace on her cheeks. She compares weeping to water that eats into steel. The image is powerful and striking - the tears (water) seem gentle and harmless, but over time, they will <em>erode</em> her beauty, health, and reputation, just as water can corrode steel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Upon my cheeks what helpless shame I feel."</strong>: This is the culmination of the stanza. All the shame she feels will be visibly etched onto her face (cheeks) because of their actions. It's a physical manifestation of the emotional trauma she has experienced. She emphasizes her helplessness - she can't stop the shame from being visible, because it's a direct result of what <em>they</em> did.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Meaning of the Stanza:</strong></p>
<p>The stanza explores the complex and devastating consequences of rape. Lucrece starts by attributing a certain mindset to her attacker(s), suggesting they now fear the judgment and exposure of their actions.  However, the stanza quickly pivots to focus on Lucrece's own experience. The core meaning is the lasting and visible impact of shame that the rape will have on Lucrece. It's not just about the physical act of the rape, but the deep, psychological wound that will forever alter her, leaving a permanent mark (etched on her face, figuratively, but also impacting her sense of self and place in society). Her shame is a direct result of their actions and she feels helpless to stop it.</p>
<p><strong>Literary Devices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double Negative (Litotes):</strong> "Think not but that" - Used for emphasis.</li>
<li><strong>Metaphor:</strong>  "Darkness" as a metaphor for secrecy and avoidance of consequences.</li>
<li><strong>Simile:</strong> "Grave, like water that doth eat in steel" - This is the most potent device, vividly illustrating the damaging effect of shame through the corrosive image of water on steel.  It suggests something slow, relentless, and ultimately destructive.</li>
<li><strong>Imagery:</strong> The stanza is full of visual imagery: eyes seeing disgrace, people hidden in darkness, tears etching shame on cheeks.</li>
<li><strong>Personification:</strong> "water that doth eat in steel" - Water is given the human characteristic of eating.</li>
<li><strong>Alliteration:</strong> "Sin remain untold" - Used to add a subtle musicality to the line.</li>
<li><strong>Shift in Subject:</strong> The change from 'they' to 'I' halfway through the stanza creates a powerful contrast between the perspective of the perpetrator and the victim. This highlights the differing burdens each carries.</li>
<li><strong>Projection/Attribution:</strong>  Lucrece begins by attributing feelings of shame and fear of exposure to the rapist, projecting what she thinks he must be feeling.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>This stanza is a powerful expression of the aftermath of a violent act, focusing not just on the physical violation but on the enduring psychological and social consequences for the victim. Shakespeare masterfully uses imagery and metaphor to convey the depth of Lucrece's shame and her sense of helplessness in the face of it. The simile of water eroding steel is particularly evocative, capturing the slow but inevitable destruction of her innocence and reputation.</p>
