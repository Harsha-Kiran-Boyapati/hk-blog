        <h1>Stanza 72 - Explanation</h1>
<h2>Original Stanza</h2>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>&#39;I have debated, even in my soul,
What wrong, what shame, what sorrow I shall breed;
But nothing can affection&#39;s course control,
Or stop the headlong fury of his speed.
I know repentant tears ensue the deed,
Reproach, disdain, and deadly enmity;
Yet strive I to embrace mine infamy.&#39;
</code></pre></div>

<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>Line-by-Line Breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"I have debated, even in my soul,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong>  The speaker (Tarquin) is acknowledging a deep inner conflict. "Debated" implies a conscious weighing of options.  "Even in my soul" intensifies the seriousness of this internal struggle. He's not just casually thinking about it; he's wrestling with his conscience at the very core of his being.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> <em>Internal Conflict</em>: This line establishes the central conflict within Tarquin. <em>Hyperbole</em>: "Even in my soul" is a slight exaggeration to emphasize the depth of his internal struggle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"What wrong, what shame, what sorrow I shall breed;"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> He's aware of the negative consequences his actions will cause.  He anticipates the "wrong" (the act itself), the "shame" (the public disgrace and loss of honor), and the "sorrow" (the suffering he will inflict on Lucrece and others).</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> <em>Triad/List of three</em>: The repetition of "what" followed by "wrong, shame, sorrow" creates a rhythmic emphasis on the negative consequences, highlighting their weight. <em>Alliteration</em>: The repetition of the 's' sound in "shame," "sorrow," and "shall" is alliterative.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"But nothing can affection's course control,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong>  Here, "affection" is a euphemism for lust or overwhelming desire.  He's claiming that his passion is so strong that it is uncontrollable. It is personified as if it has its own course and it cannot be changed.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> <em>Euphemism</em>: "Affection" softens the bluntness of lust. <em>Personification</em>: "Affection" is given a "course" implying it's an external force acting upon him.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Or stop the headlong fury of his speed."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> This reinforces the previous line. The "headlong fury" describes the reckless, uncontrolled nature of his desire.  "Speed" implies that this desire is rapidly accelerating. It builds on the personification that affection has its own force.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> <em>Metaphor</em>:  Desire is compared to a "headlong fury" implying its destructive and impulsive nature. <em>Alliteration</em>: The repetition of the 'h' sound in "headlong" is alliterative. <em>Personification</em>: The fury is given the power of movement and speed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"I know repentant tears ensue the deed,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong>  He's fully aware that he will feel remorseful ("repentant tears") <em>after</em> he commits the act. He is not ignorant of the consequences, the knowledge doesn't deter him.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> <em>Foreshadowing</em>: This line hints at the inevitable guilt and regret Tarquin will experience. <em>Irony</em>: He acknowledges the future regret, yet continues on his path.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Reproach, disdain, and deadly enmity;"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> He foresees the societal and personal consequences that will follow: "reproach" (censure from others), "disdain" (the scorn of Lucrece and others), and "deadly enmity" (the lasting hatred and potential for revenge).</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> <em>Triad/List of three</em>:  The repetition of the nouns "reproach, disdain, and deadly enmity" creates a dramatic impact. <em>Assonance</em>: The repetition of the 'e' sound in "reproach," "deadly," and "enmity" creates a harmonic effect.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Yet strive I to embrace mine infamy."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Despite knowing all the negative consequences (shame, sorrow, future regret, societal condemnation), he is actively <em>choosing</em> to pursue his desire. He is "striving" to commit this infamous act. "Embrace" is shocking ‚Äì it suggests a perverse willingness to accept the disgrace.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> <em>Paradox/Oxymoron</em>:  "Embrace mine infamy" is a paradox. "Embrace" typically denotes affection or acceptance, whereas "infamy" is something to be avoided.  This juxtaposition highlights the irrationality of his desire. <em>Foreshadowing</em>: This line foreshadows his ultimate fall from grace and reputation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Meaning:</strong></p>
<p>This stanza reveals the internal turmoil of Tarquin as he contemplates the rape of Lucrece. He is not ignorant of the wrongness of his actions. He understands the profound consequences ‚Äì the pain he will inflict, the shame he will bring upon himself, and the lasting hatred he will inspire. Despite this knowledge, he claims to be powerless against the overwhelming force of his lust. In the end, he chooses to surrender to his desire, even embracing the "infamy" that will inevitably follow. It demonstrates his descent from rational thought to uncontrolled passion.</p>

<li><strong>Euphemism:</strong> "Affection" for lust.</li>
<li><strong>Personification:</strong> Giving human qualities to "affection" and "fury."</li>
<li><strong>Metaphor:</strong>  Desire as a "headlong fury."</li>
<li><strong>Triad/List of Three:</strong> Emphasizing the negative consequences.</li>
<li><strong>Foreshadowing:</strong> Hinting at Tarquin's future guilt and Lucrece's fate.</li>
