<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<p>Okay, let's break down this stanza from Shakespeare's <em>The Rape of Lucrece</em> line by line and then look at its overall meaning and literary devices.</p>
<p><strong>Line-by-Line Breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"The precedent whereof in Lucrece view,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Precedent:</em> An earlier event or action that serves as an example or justification for subsequent events.</li>
<li><em>Whereof:</em>  Of which (referring to a situation of extreme moral conflict or danger).</li>
<li><em>In Lucrece view:</em> To be seen, or considered in Lucrece's case.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong>  Consider Lucrece's situation as an example of this [moral dilemma/predicament].</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Assail'd by night with circumstances strong"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Assail'd:</em> Attacked.</li>
<li><em>By night:</em> Emphasizes the sneakiness, darkness, and treachery of the attack.</li>
<li><em>Circumstances strong:</em> Overwhelming or powerful conditions/factors influencing the situation.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> She was attacked in the night by powerful influencing factors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Of present death, and shame that might ensue"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Present death:</em> Imminent death, the threat of dying at that very moment.</li>
<li><em>Shame that might ensue:</em> The disgrace that could follow (if she resisted or was discovered, or even just as a consequence of the rape itself). <em>Ensuing</em> indicates consequence and future effect.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Those factors/circumstances being the threat of immediate death and the potential shame that would follow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"By that her death, to do her husband wrong:"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>By that her death:</em> Through or because of her death</li>
<li><em>To do her husband wrong:</em> To dishonor her husband</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Even her death would wrong her husband in some way - by association, or the shame it would bring to his house.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Such danger to resistance did belong,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Such danger to resistance did belong:</em> Resistance would entail such grave consequences, such terrible risks. The word <em>belong</em> implies that great danger is a natural consequence of defiance.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Resisting the attack would be very dangerous.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"That dying fear through all her body spread;"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Dying fear:</em> A fear so intense it feels like death itself.</li>
<li><em>Through all her body spread:</em> This emphasizes the physical manifestation of her fear, making it tangible and visceral.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> An overwhelming fear, almost like death, consumed her entire body.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"And who cannot abuse a body dead?"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is a rhetorical question, and it's a chilling one.</li>
<li><em>Who cannot abuse a body dead?:</em>  The implication is that <em>anyone</em> can, and that a dead body is completely vulnerable and without any recourse.  Even if she died resisting, Tarquin could still further desecrate her corpse.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Even if she were to die resisting, her body would still be vulnerable to further abuse and dishonor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Meaning of the Stanza:</strong></p>
<p>This stanza presents the immense pressure and psychological torment Lucrece faced when she was attacked by Tarquin. It highlights the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The No-Win Situation:</strong> Lucrece found herself in a situation where every choice was fraught with danger and potential dishonor. Whether she resisted, submitted, or died, shame and wrong would be done.</li>
<li><strong>The Power of Fear:</strong> The stanza emphasizes the debilitating effect of fear. It was so intense that it permeated her entire being, hindering her ability to resist or think clearly.</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability and Powerlessness:</strong>  The rhetorical question at the end is a stark reminder of Lucrece's utter vulnerability. Even in death, she would not be safe from further desecration. The stanza underscores the complete power imbalance between Lucrece and Tarquin.</li>
<li><strong>The Context of Honor:</strong> The stanza is deeply concerned with honor‚ÄîLucrece's honor, her husband's honor, and the reputation of her family. The fear of shame is a powerful motivator in the poem.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Literary Devices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rhetorical Question:</strong> The final line, "And who cannot abuse a body dead?" is a rhetorical question. It is not meant to be answered but rather to emphasize the utter vulnerability of a dead body and to provoke a sense of outrage in the reader.</li>
<li><strong>Imagery:</strong> The line "That dying fear through all her body spread" uses vivid imagery to convey the intensity of Lucrece's fear. The phrase "dying fear" is also an example of <em>hyperbole</em>, exaggeration for effect.</li>
<li><strong>Alliteration:</strong> While not prominent, the phrase "present death" uses alliteration for emphasis.</li>
<li><strong>Juxtaposition:</strong> The stanza juxtaposes the idea of "present death" with the potential for future "shame," highlighting the dual threats Lucrece faced.</li>
<li><strong>Historical Allusion:</strong> The stanza contributes to the overall narrative that's a part of Roman history/legend, setting up the backdrop against which Lucrece's tragedy unfolds.</li>
<li><strong>Personification:</strong> "Such danger to resistance did belong" could be seen as a mild form of personification, as danger is given the ability to "belong" to something.</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, this stanza is a crucial moment in the poem because it reveals the terrifying circumstances Lucrece faces, making her subsequent rape and suicide more understandable and tragic. It sets the stage for the moral and political consequences that will follow.</p>
