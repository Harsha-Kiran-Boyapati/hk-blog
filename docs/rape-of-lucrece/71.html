<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>Line-by-Line Breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"I see what crosses my attempt will bring;"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> "I understand the negative consequences that will result from thwarting my desires." He is acknowledging that pursuing Lucrece will have terrible repercussions. He's not oblivious to the potential damage. "Crosses" here means obstacles but also negative outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Device:</strong> Foreshadowing (hints at the impending tragedy).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"I know what thorns the growing rose defends;"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> "I am aware of the dangers and difficulties that protect beauty and virtue." The rose is Lucrece, and the thorns represent her chastity, her husband, societal expectations, and the potential for resistance. He knows she's not an easy target.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Device:</strong> Metaphor. The rose symbolizes beauty and virtue; the thorns symbolize the protective measures around it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"I think the honey guarded with a sting;"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> "I believe that desirable things (like Lucrece's beauty and virtue) are often protected by painful consequences or resistance." Similar to the rose and thorns, this uses the image of honey to symbolize something sweet and desirable, guarded by the pain of a sting.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Device:</strong> Metaphor.  The honey represents desirability and the sting represents the danger or pain associated with obtaining it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"All this beforehand counsel comprehends:"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> "My rational mind ("counsel") understands and acknowledges all of these potential dangers and consequences <em>before</em> I act."  His intellect understands the risks; he is not acting out of ignorance.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Device:</strong> Personification. "Counsel" is given the ability to "comprehend," representing Collatine's rational mind.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"But will is deaf and hears no heedful friends;"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> "However, my desire ("will") is stubborn and ignores the wise advice of reason and friends (internal or external)." He's admitting that his lust overrides his logical thought. "Will" here means desire, particularly lust.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Device:</strong> Personification. "Will" is given the ability to be "deaf" and ignore "heedful friends," which emphasizes the power of uncontrolled desire. Metaphor - "heedful friends" are not literal people, but a metaphor for rational thought or external advice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Only he hath an eye to gaze on beauty,"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> "His desire only sees Lucrece's beauty." It is blinded by it.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Device:</strong> Synecdoche - 'eye' is used to represent his desire and focus on the external beauty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"And dotes on what he looks, 'gainst law or duty."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> "And is infatuated with what it sees, even though it goes against both legal and moral obligations." "Dotes" means to be excessively fond of. He is captivated by Lucrece to the point where he disregards morality and the law.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Device:</strong> Antithesis. "Law or duty" emphasizes the violation of both social (law) and personal (duty) obligations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Meaning:</strong></p>
<p>This stanza reveals the internal conflict within the speaker (Tarquin). He is fully aware of the potential consequences of his actions and the moral implications of his desire for Lucrece. His rational mind recognizes the thorns guarding the rose, the sting protecting the honey, and the potential destruction his pursuit could unleash. However, he is ultimately powerless to resist his "will," or lust, which blinds him to everything except the object of his desire. The stanza sets up the tragic events that follow, emphasizing the power of unchecked desire to override reason and morality. It highlights the human capacity for self-destructive behavior, even when fully aware of the risks.</p>
<p><strong>Key Literary Devices Emphasized:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Metaphor:</strong> The rose and thorns, honey and sting are all metaphors for Lucrece's beauty and the dangers/resistance surrounding it.</li>
<li><strong>Personification:</strong> "Counsel" comprehends and "will" is deaf, giving human qualities to abstract concepts to emphasize the internal conflict.</li>
<li><strong>Foreshadowing:</strong> The first line hints at the tragic consequences that will follow.</li>
<li><strong>Antithesis:</strong> "Law or duty" highlights the blatant violation of both.</li>
<li><strong>Synecdoche:</strong> 'eye' for Tarquin's desire.</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, this stanza is a microcosm of the entire poem's theme: the destructive power of lust when it overpowers reason and morality. It demonstrates that knowledge of right and wrong is not enough to prevent wrongdoing if the "will" is allowed to run rampant.</p>
