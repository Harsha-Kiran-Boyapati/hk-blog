        <h1>Stanza 199 - Explanation</h1>
<h2>Original Stanza</h2>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>In great commanders grace and majesty
You might behold, triumphing in their faces;
In youth, quick bearing and dexterity;
And here and there the painter interlaces
Pale cowards marching on with trembling paces,
Which heartless peasants did so well resemble,
That one would swear he saw them quake and tremble.
</code></pre></div>

<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<p>Okay, let's break down Stanza 199 from Shakespeare's <em>The Rape of Lucrece</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Line-by-Line Breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"In great commanders grace and majesty"</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong>  This line suggests that one would typically observe grace and kingly dignity (majesty) in the faces of great military leaders.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong>  <strong>Abstract Nouns:</strong> "Grace" and "majesty" evoke qualities associated with leadership. It sets up the expected image of valiant individuals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"You might behold, triumphing in their faces;"</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> You would see triumph displayed upon the faces of these commanders; a display of victory and success.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong>  <strong>Personification:</strong> "Triumphing" gives human characteristics to an abstract concept, implying the emotions are visible in their countenance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"In youth, quick bearing and dexterity;"</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> In young men, you would observe agility (quick bearing) and skillful movement (dexterity). This line focuses on the physical attributes expected of young soldiers.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> <strong>Abstract Nouns:</strong> "Bearing" and "dexterity" describe qualities and abilities, continuing the depiction of expected traits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"And here and there the painter interlaces"</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Now the poem takes a turn. "The painter" is a metaphor for the creator of a scene. Here and there, this painter (or the scene itself) includes...</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong>  <strong>Metaphor:</strong> The painter is a representation of either a real painter depicting this scene, or a more metaphorical "painter" of the scene through the poet's words. It represents art imitating life, or life being represented through art.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Pale cowards marching on with trembling paces,"</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Pale, cowardly soldiers are depicted marching with shaky or unsteady steps. This contrasts sharply with the previous images of strength and confidence.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> <strong>Juxtaposition/Contrast:</strong> This line creates a strong contrast with the earlier lines about commanders and youth.  <strong>Imagery:</strong> The description paints a vivid picture of fear and weakness ("Pale," "trembling").</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Which heartless peasants did so well resemble,"</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> The cowardly soldiers looked very much like peasants who lacked courage, suggesting a similar demeanor and fear. "Heartless" could mean lacking courage, but also that they are just ignorant.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> <strong>Simile:</strong> The line implies a comparison between the cowards and peasants ("did so well resemble"), even if it's not explicit with "like" or "as".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"That one would swear he saw them quake and tremble."</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> One would believe they actually saw these figures shaking and trembling because their fear was so palpable. This emphasizes the convincing depiction of cowardice.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Devices:</strong> <strong>Hyperbole:</strong> The exaggeration of one swearing they saw them quake and tremble heightens the feeling of cowardice. <strong>Sensory Imagery:</strong> The words "quake and tremble" appeal to a visual and almost tactile sense of fear.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Meaning of the Stanza:</strong></p>
<p>This stanza uses a comparison and contrast structure to highlight the theme of <em>appearance versus reality</em> and the deceptive nature of outward displays.  It begins by describing the expected traits of leaders (grace, majesty, triumph) and youth (agility, skill).  However, it then introduces the disturbing image of "pale cowards" who are indistinguishable from fearful peasants. This juxtaposition underscores the idea that outward appearance can be deceiving, and that even in a context of war or heroic narrative, fear and weakness can be present and even pervasive.  It suggests a breakdown in the expected social order, where soldiers, who are supposed to be brave, resemble the very bottom of the social ladder, the peasants.</p>
<p>In the context of <em>The Rape of Lucrece</em>, this stanza likely sets up a theme of how appearances can be deceiving, and it may foreshadow the vulnerability of individuals, even those in positions of power or expected strength. It could also be seen as a commentary on the fragility of courage, and the potential for fear to undermine even the most seemingly steadfast individuals. The stanza emphasizes the inner turmoil and potential cowardice that can lurk beneath a facade of strength, thus setting the stage for the tragic events to follow, as the seemingly powerful Tarquin succumbs to his lust and commits his heinous act.</p>
