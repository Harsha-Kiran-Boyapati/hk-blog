        <h1>Stanza 229 - Explanation</h1>
<h2>Original Stanza</h2>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>At last he takes her by the bloodless hand,
And thus begins: ‚ÄúWhat uncouth ill event
Hath thee befall‚Äôn, that thou dost trembling stand?
Sweet love, what spite hath thy fair colour spent?
Why art thou thus attired in discontent?
Unmask, dear dear, this moody heaviness,
And tell thy grief, that we may give redress.‚Äù
</code></pre></div>

<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<p>Let's break down stanza 229 of Shakespeare's <em>The Rape of Lucrece</em> line by line, identify the literary devices, and then discuss the overall meaning within the context of the poem.</p>
<p><strong>Line-by-Line Breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"At last he takes her by the bloodless hand"</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning</strong>: Collatine, Lucrece's husband, finally takes her hand, which is described as "bloodless."</li>
<li><strong>Analysis</strong>: The "bloodless hand" is a significant detail. It symbolizes Lucrece's loss of vitality, innocence, and even life force after the rape. Blood is often associated with passion, vigor, and health. Its absence here underscores her emotional and physical devastation. <em>Imagery is used to show what Lucrece looks like.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"And thus begins: ‚ÄúWhat uncouth ill event"</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning</strong>: Collatine starts to speak, wondering about the bad thing that has happened to her. The word uncouth suggests something foreign or unknown.</li>
<li><strong>Analysis</strong>: This line introduces Collatine's questioning and his initial lack of understanding about the severity of what has occurred. <em>There is alliteration here as well in 'Uncouth ill event'.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Hath thee befall‚Äôn, that thou dost trembling stand?"</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning</strong>: "What terrible thing has happened to you, that you are standing there trembling?"</li>
<li><strong>Analysis</strong>: Collatine notes Lucrece's physical state, emphasizing her fear and vulnerability. The archaic language ("hath thee befall'n," "dost trembling stand") adds to the poem's formal and elevated tone. <em>'thou dost trembling stand' is a use of alliteration.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Sweet love, what spite hath thy fair colour spent?"</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning</strong>: "My dear, what malice (spite) has taken away your beautiful complexion/colour?"</li>
<li><strong>Analysis</strong>: Collatine expresses his concern and uses the term "Sweet love" to address Lucrece. The question focuses on the alteration of her appearance, suggesting that something malicious has robbed her of her beauty and vivacity. "Fair colour spent" is a euphemism for her loss of health and vitality, implying that the event has stolen her life force. <em>Again, imagery is shown here.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Why art thou thus attired in discontent?"</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning</strong>: "Why are you dressed in such a way that shows unhappiness?"</li>
<li><strong>Analysis</strong>: Collatine questions Lucrece's appearance, noting that her clothing and demeanor reflect her profound unhappiness. "Attired in discontent" suggests that her very being is saturated with sorrow. The word choice contributes to the overall atmosphere of tragedy and despair. <em>Imagery is evident within this line.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Unmask, dear dear, this moody heaviness,"</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning</strong>: "Take off the mask (reveal), my dear, this sad and oppressive mood."</li>
<li><strong>Analysis</strong>: "Unmask" is a metaphorical plea for Lucrece to remove the emotional barrier that she has erected. Collatine implores her to reveal the source of her "moody heaviness," suggesting a weight of sorrow that she is carrying. The repetition of "dear" emphasizes his concern and affection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"And tell thy grief, that we may give redress.‚Äù</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning</strong>: "And tell us what is making you sad, so that we can fix it."</li>
<li><strong>Analysis</strong>: Collatine offers a solution, stating that once he knows her grief, he and others can "give redress." This implies that he believes the situation can be resolved or rectified, which is tragically ironic, since the rape is irreversible and leads to Lucrece's suicide. <em>This line indicates the theme of justice, which is important in the poem.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Literary Devices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Imagery</strong>: The "bloodless hand," "fair colour spent," and "attired in discontent" all create vivid images that contribute to the stanza's emotional impact.</li>
<li><strong>Archaic Language</strong>: The use of phrases like "hath thee befall'n" and "dost trembling stand" adds to the formality and gravity of the scene.</li>
<li><strong>Metaphor</strong>: "Unmask, dear dear, this moody heaviness" is a metaphor that suggests Lucrece is hiding her true feelings behind a mask of sorrow.</li>
<li><strong>Alliteration</strong>:  "Uncouth ill event", "thou dost trembling stand"</li>
<li><strong>Euphemism</strong>: "Fair colour spent"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Meaning:</strong></p>
<p>The stanza serves as a poignant illustration of Collatine's initial reaction to Lucrece's trauma. He is deeply concerned about her distress and puzzled by her changed appearance. His words are filled with affection and a genuine desire to help. However, he fails to grasp the true nature and magnitude of the violation she has suffered. This is because the very nature of rape makes it unspeakable, and Lucrece is struggling to articulate what has happened to her. Collatine's promise of "redress" is also deeply ironic, as the only "redress" Lucrece can imagine for such a profound violation is her own death. The stanza underscores the tragic gap between Collatine's well-intentioned concern and the insurmountable horror that Lucrece is grappling with. It sets the stage for the revelation of the rape and the subsequent events that lead to Lucrece's suicide. The language and imagery used portray her as helpless and completely changed after the rape.</p>
