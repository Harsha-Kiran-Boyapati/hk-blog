<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<p>Let's break down stanza 87 of 'The Rape of Lucrece' line by line, and then consider the overall meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 1: 'How will thy shame be seeded in thine age,'</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Analysis:</strong> This line asks how Tarquin's shame will fester and grow as he gets older. The metaphor of "seeded" suggests that the shame is like a plant that will grow from a seed into something significant and potentially damaging.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Device:</strong> Metaphor (shame as a seed). Personification (shame is able to be seeded).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 2: 'When thus thy vices bud before thy spring!'</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Analysis:</strong> This line highlights that Tarquin's vices are emerging ("budding") even before he is fully in power ("spring" represents his reign as king). It implies that his evil actions are premature and foreshadow an even greater corruption to come.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Device:</strong> Metaphor ("spring" representing his reign). Allusion (to spring as a time of growth).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 3: 'If in thy hope thou darest do such outrage,'</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Analysis:</strong> This line presents a conditional statement. "In thy hope" could refer to hope of the throne, or simply hope of getting away with his actions. It is saying, "If you dare to commit such a terrible act while still only aspiring to the throne (or hoping for personal gain),..." It focuses on the audacity of his crime given his current position.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Device:</strong> Rhetorical question.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 4: 'What darest thou not when once thou art a king?'</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Analysis:</strong> This line is the conclusion of the conditional statement started in line 3. It completes the rhetorical question with "What won't you dare to do once you are king?" It suggests that once he has absolute power, there will be no limit to his depravity. His potential for evil is limitless.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Device:</strong> Rhetorical question. Foreshadowing (of further abuses of power).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 5: 'O, be remember'd, no outrageous thing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Analysis:</strong> This is a direct address - a warning that is spoken directly to Tarquin and to the audience. "Be remembered" is Shakespeare's use of archaic language, but it is simply a plea to remember something important.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Device:</strong> Apostrophe (direct address).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 6: 'From vassal actors can be wiped away;'</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Analysis:</strong> A "vassal actor" means someone in a subordinate role who carries out another's orders. It suggests that no terrible deed done by those who are beneath Tarquin and following his orders can be excused by the claim that they were just following orders. No horrible act by a lower-class citizen can be erased.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Device:</strong> Implies a political or social hierarchy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line 7: 'Then kings' misdeeds cannot be hid in clay.'</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Analysis:</strong> This final line implies that the mistakes and misdeeds of the kings cannot be covered up, ignored, or hidden once they are done. Even in death "clay" cannot hide or protect them from the consequences and repercussions of their wrongdoings. Clay is a metaphor for death, covering the body after burial, but the deeds will come back to haunt them. The line also contrasts kings and vassal actors, suggesting their behavior is held to different standards.</li>
<li><strong>Literary Device:</strong> Metaphor (clay representing death and attempted concealment). Juxtaposition (of kings and "vassal actors").</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Meaning:</strong></p>
<p>This stanza is a powerful condemnation of Tarquin's actions and a dire warning about the potential for corruption when unchecked power is involved. It emphasizes the lasting consequences of his crime, predicting that his shame will only grow with time and that his potential for evil is limitless once he becomes king. The stanza suggests that the misdeeds of kings are never truly hidden and will inevitably lead to consequences. It highlights the importance of accountability, especially for those in positions of authority, and underscores the idea that power corrupts. The stanza is both a critique of Tarquin's character and a commentary on the nature of power and responsibility. It warns of the danger of unchecked ambition and the lasting impact of even a single act of "outrage."</p>
