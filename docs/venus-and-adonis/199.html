<h2>üéØ Overall Meaning &amp; Significance in the Context of the Poem</h2>
<p>This final stanza shows Venus's complete withdrawal from the mortal world after her traumatic experience with love and loss. She returns to her divine origins but chooses isolation over participation in either mortal or divine affairs.</p>
<p><strong>The Divine Retreat</strong>: Venus's departure represents the withdrawal of love's divine presence from the mortal world. After Adonis's death, the goddess of love abandons humanity.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Imposed Exile</strong>: Venus doesn't just return to her divine realm‚Äîshe chooses to "immure herself," suggesting that even divine society is now unbearable to her.</p>
<p><strong>The Empty Universe</strong>: The "empty skies" suggest that Venus's departure leaves the universe diminished and lonely, reflecting her own emotional state.</p>
<p><strong>Return to Origins</strong>: Paphos was Venus's birthplace where she first emerged from the sea foam. Her return suggests a desire to restart or retreat to her original, uncomplicated divine state.</p>
<p><strong>The Speed of Escape</strong>: The emphasis on swiftness ("hies," "swift," "quickly") shows Venus's desperate need to escape the scene of her trauma as rapidly as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Divine Abandonment</strong>: Venus's withdrawal means that love itself has become wounded and hidden from the world, explaining why love will henceforth be troubled (as per her curse).</p>
<p><strong>The End of Accessibility</strong>: By choosing to be "not seen," Venus removes herself from human access, making love less available and more mysterious.</p>
<p><strong>Circular Completion</strong>: The poem ends where Venus began‚Äîas a powerful goddess‚Äîbut she's now traumatized and withdrawn rather than actively pursuing love.</p>
<p><strong>The Light Chariot</strong>: Her "light chariot" suggests both physical lightness (speed) and spiritual illumination, but this light is now departing from the world.</p>
<p><strong>Universal Consequences</strong>: Venus's personal trauma becomes cosmic‚Äîher withdrawal affects all future human love, making her private grief into universal law.</p>
<p><strong>The Final Isolation</strong>: Even in her divine realm, Venus chooses complete solitude, suggesting that love itself has become isolated and self-contained rather than connective.</p>
<p>This stanza completes the transformation of Venus from an active, pursuing goddess of love into a withdrawn, traumatized deity whose absence explains the difficulties of human love. The poem ends not with resolution but with divine abandonment, leaving humanity to face love's challenges without divine guidance.</p>
