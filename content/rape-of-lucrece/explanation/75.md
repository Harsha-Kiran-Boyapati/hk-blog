# Stanza 75 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
'So thy surviving husband shall remain
The scornful mark of every open eye;
Thy kinsmen hang their heads at this disdain,
Thy issue blurr'd with nameless bastardy:
And thou, the author of their obloquy,
Shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes,
And sung by children in succeeding times.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"So thy surviving husband shall remain"**

    *   **Breakdown:** This line sets up the consequences Lucrece's actions (specifically, Tarquin's rape of her) will have on her husband, Collatinus, after her death. "So" indicates this is a direct consequence of the rape and her subsequent suicide.
    *   **Interpretation:** Her husband's life will be forever altered and defined by this horrific event. He will be permanently marked.

*   **"The scornful mark of every open eye;"**

    *   **Breakdown:** This expands on the first line. Collatinus will not just be changed, he will be publicly shamed. "Open eye" suggests that everyone will be aware of his humiliation and be openly critical of him.
    *   **Interpretation:** He will be the object of public ridicule and contempt. He will be seen as weak or incapable of protecting his honor and his wife's. The phrase "scornful mark" is significant; it's a *metaphor* suggesting he's branded by this shame, visible to all.

*   **"Thy kinsmen hang their heads at this disdain,"**

    *   **Breakdown:** This moves beyond the husband to Lucrece's extended family. "Kinsmen" refers to her male relatives, the ones who would be responsible for defending her honor. "Hang their heads" is a physical representation of shame and defeat. "Disdain" reinforces the idea of widespread contempt.
    *   **Interpretation:** Her family will be humiliated and deeply ashamed by what has happened to her. They will feel they have failed in their duty to protect her and their family's reputation.

*   **"Thy issue blurr'd with nameless bastardy:"**

    *   **Breakdown:** This line considers the impact on her children (or the children she *would* have had, if she weren't so traumatized by the rape). "Issue" means offspring. "Blurred with nameless bastardy" is a complex and harsh phrase. Since the rape has shattered her honor, the question of Lucrece's future children's paternity will be raised; they could be considered illegitimate, or "bastards". "Nameless" reinforces the idea that their true father is unknown, causing them to be dishonored.
    *   **Interpretation:** Her future descendants will be tainted by this scandal. Their legitimacy and social standing will be forever questioned, and they will carry the stigma of her shame.

*   **"And thou, the author of their obloquy,"**

    *   **Breakdown:** "Thou" is Lucrece. "Author" implies responsibility or origin. "Obloquy" means strong public criticism or condemnation; disgrace. This is a controversial line, placing (in a way) the *blame* for all of this on Lucrece.
    *   **Interpretation:** This line argues that Lucrece, through her suicide (precipitated by the rape), will be seen as the cause of all the disgrace that befalls her family. It's a complex and arguably unfair accusation, but it reflects the patriarchal values of the time, where a woman's honor was seen as the foundation of the family's reputation. Note the *irony*: she is the *victim* of a crime, yet deemed the "author" of the shame.

*   **"Shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes,"**

    *   **Breakdown:** "Trespass" can mean sin, transgression, or violation (referring to Tarquin's rape, but implying also the perceived sin of her suicide). "Cited up in rhymes" means that her story will be told in poems and songs.
    *   **Interpretation:** Her tragic story, including the violation she suffered and her suicide, will be immortalized in verse.

*   **"And sung by children in succeeding times."**

    *   **Breakdown:** This emphasizes the lasting impact of her story. "Succeeding times" means future generations.
    *   **Interpretation:** The tale of Lucrece's rape and its consequences will be passed down through generations, becoming a cautionary tale and a permanent part of cultural memory.

**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza outlines the devastating and far-reaching consequences of Lucrece's rape. It depicts the shame and disgrace that will befall her husband, her family, and her potential descendants. It also highlights the paradox of her situation, where she, the victim, is also held responsible for the shame and obloquy that follows. Ultimately, the stanza suggests that Lucrece's tragedy will become a cautionary tale, forever etched in the collective memory of society.

**Literary Devices:**

*   **Metaphor:** "The scornful mark" is a metaphor for the enduring shame and public humiliation that Collatinus will bear.
*   **Irony:** The attribution of authorship to Lucrece, when she is actually the victim of Tarquin's violence.
*   **Imagery:** The image of kinsmen "hanging their heads" is a vivid and symbolic representation of shame and defeat.
*   **Allusion:** The stanza contributes to the overall poem's engagement with classical themes of honor, virtue, and the consequences of transgression.
*   **Foreshadowing:** This stanza can be seen as foreshadowing the future political upheaval and rebellion that will eventually overthrow the Tarquin monarchy, as the rape of Lucrece is a key catalyst for those events.
*   **Juxtaposition:** The stanza juxtaposes the personal tragedy of Lucrece with the public and political ramifications of her rape.

The stanza is powerful because it explores the themes of honor, shame, responsibility, and the lasting impact of violence on individuals and society. It's a complex and nuanced portrayal of a tragic situation, highlighting the societal pressures and expectations that contribute to Lucrece's fate.
