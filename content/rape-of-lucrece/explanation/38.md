# Stanza 38 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
'And how her hand, in my hand being lock'd
Forced it to tremble with her loyal fear!
Which struck her sad, and then it faster rock'd,
Until her husband's welfare she did hear;
Whereat she smiled with so sweet a cheer,
That had Narcissus seen her as she stood,
Self-love had never drown'd him in the flood.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
This stanza from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* focuses on Lucrece's reaction to the threat of rape, specifically highlighting her internal struggle and the power of her loyalty. Let's break it down line by line:


* **"And how her hand, in my hand being lock'd"**:  This begins with an observation, seemingly from the perspective of Tarquin (though it's presented within Lucrece's internal monologue or a narrator's account of her experience).  He notes the physical contact, the locking of hands, implying a moment of intimacy or attempted intimacy before the assault.  The phrasing is deliberately understated.

* **"Forced it to tremble with her loyal fear!"**: This is crucial. Lucrece's hand trembles not from fear of Tarquin's physical power (at least not primarily), but from "loyal fear"‚Äîfear for her husband's honor and well-being.  This establishes her steadfast virtue and prioritization of her marital vows over her own immediate safety. The use of "forced" suggests the involuntary nature of her trembling, a manifestation of her intense inner turmoil.

* **"Which struck her sad, and then it faster rock'd,"**: The trembling ("which") is the cause of her sadness, emphasizing the connection between her physical reaction and her emotional state.  The "faster rock'd" uses a metaphor of a rocking or swaying movement, suggesting the increasing intensity of her fear and anxiety.  The image is both physical and emotional.

* **"Until her husband's welfare she did hear;"**: This line provides the resolution, albeit temporary, to Lucrece's anxiety. The news of her husband's well-being provides a moment of relief, a temporary respite from the overwhelming fear.


* **"Whereat she smiled with so sweet a cheer,"**:  This presents a stark contrast to the previous lines. The relief leads to a beautiful, genuine smile. "Cheer" implies both happiness and courage.

* **"That had Narcissus seen her as she stood,"**:  This introduces a hypothetical scenario, a powerful *hypothetical simile*.  Narcissus, the mythical figure who fell in love with his own reflection, is invoked here.

* **"Self-love had never drown'd him in the flood."**:  This line completes the simile. Lucrece's beauty is so captivating that even Narcissus, consumed by self-love, would have been distracted from his own reflection, implying her beauty surpasses even that which captivated the vain Narcissus.  The "flood" refers to the pool in which Narcissus died.

**Literary Devices:**

* **Simile (extended):** The comparison of Lucrece's beauty to its ability to surpass Narcissus' self-obsession is a sustained simile that runs through the final two lines.
* **Metaphor:**  "Faster rock'd" is a metaphor for the intensification of her fear.
* **Enjambment:**  The run-on lines create a sense of continuous flow, mirroring the continuous nature of Lucrece's emotional experience.
* **Personification:** The hand's trembling is almost personified, acting independently.
* **Understatement:** The description of the physical encounter between Tarquin and Lucrece is very understated in the first line compared to the intense emotion described later.


**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza masterfully portrays Lucrece's strength and virtue through her reaction to fear. Her primary concern is not her own safety, but her husband's welfare. Her trembling hand, her sadness, and her subsequent smile all emphasize the depth of her loyalty and the profound impact of the looming threat. The final lines, using the Narcissus simile, highlight her extraordinary beauty and the power it holds, even in the face of immense distress. The stanza is not just about physical beauty, but also about inner strength and the unwavering dedication to her marital vows which eventually becomes a key factor in her later tragic choice.
