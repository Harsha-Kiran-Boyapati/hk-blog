# Stanza 23 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
Such hazard now must doting Tarquin make,
Pawning his honour to obtain his lust;
And for himself himself be must forsake:
Then where is truth, if there be no self-trust?
When shall he think to find a stranger just,
When he himself himself confounds, betrays
To slanderous tongues and wretched hateful days?
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
This stanza from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* explores the moral decay and self-destruction of Tarquin, highlighting the consequences of his lustful pursuit of Lucrece. Let's break down each line:

* **Line 1: "Such hazard now must doting Tarquin make,"**  This line introduces the central idea: Tarquin, described as "doting" (suggestive of senility or infatuation), is taking a significant risk.  "Hazard" refers to the danger he puts himself in morally and potentially physically.  The word "must" emphasizes the inevitability of his actions, driven by his overwhelming desire.

* **Line 2: "Pawning his honour to obtain his lust;"**  This line reveals the nature of the risk. Tarquin is "pawning" his honor‚Äîhis reputation and integrity‚Äîas collateral to achieve his "lust." This is a powerful metaphor, implying a transaction where he sacrifices something precious for something base.

* **Line 3: "And for himself himself be must forsake:"** This line is the crux of the stanza. It uses striking repetition ("himself himself") to emphasize Tarquin's complete self-betrayal. He is abandoning his own best interests and moral compass in pursuit of his desires.  The use of "forsake" suggests a deliberate rejection of his own self.

* **Line 4: "Then where is truth, if there be no self-trust?"** This line poses a rhetorical question, highlighting the inherent connection between self-respect and truthfulness. If one cannot trust oneself, how can others trust them?  This line introduces a broader philosophical reflection on the consequences of self-betrayal.

* **Line 5: "When shall he think to find a stranger just,"** This line continues the rhetorical questioning.  If Tarquin cannot be just to himself, how can he expect justice or fairness from others ("a stranger")? It implies a lack of credibility and the impossibility of finding trust outside of oneself when one has lost internal integrity.

* **Line 6-7: "When he himself himself confounds, betrays / To slanderous tongues and wretched hateful days?"**  These lines conclude the stanza by highlighting the inevitable consequences of Tarquin's actions. He "confounds" (ruins) and "betrays" himself, leaving himself vulnerable to "slanderous tongues" (gossip and accusations) and "wretched hateful days" (a life filled with misery and regret). The repetition of "himself" reinforces the self-inflicted nature of his suffering.

**Literary Devices:**

* **Anaphora:** The repetition of "himself himself" in lines 3 and 6 emphasizes the severity of Tarquin's self-betrayal.
* **Rhetorical Questions:** The questions in lines 4 and 5 are not meant to be answered literally; they serve to emphasize the absurdity of Tarquin's actions and their consequences.
* **Metaphor:** "Pawning his honour" is a strong metaphor illustrating the transactional nature of Tarquin's actions.
* **Personification:** "Slanderous tongues" gives human-like qualities to gossip and accusations, emphasizing their power to harm.


**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza powerfully illustrates the self-destructive nature of unchecked lust and the erosion of moral integrity.  Tarquin's pursuit of Lucrece leads him to betray himself, undermining his own sense of self-worth and making him vulnerable to external judgment and suffering.  Shakespeare uses vivid language and rhetorical techniques to underscore the inextricable link between self-respect, truth, and the consequences of moral failure.  The stanza acts as a warning about the dangers of prioritizing base desires over personal integrity.
