# Stanza 176 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
But as the earth doth weep, the sun being set,
Each flower moisten'd like a melting eye;
Even so the maid with swelling drops gan wet
Her circled eyne, enforced by sympathy
Of those fair suns set in her mistress' sky,
Who in a salt-waved ocean quench their light,
Which makes the maid weep like the dewy night.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down Stanza 176 of Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* line by line and then provide an overall interpretation, paying attention to literary devices.

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"But as the earth doth weep, the sun being set,"**
    *   *Literal Meaning:* Just as the earth seems to weep with dew when the sun goes down.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Personification:** "Earth doth weep" gives the earth human qualities.
        *   **Simile:** The entire line initiates a comparison ("as...")
        *   **Imagery:** Creates a visual image of a dewy landscape at sunset.

*   **"Each flower moisten'd like a melting eye;"**
    *   *Literal Meaning:* Each flower is moistened with dew, resembling a weeping eye.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Simile:** ("like") directly compares the dew-covered flower to a "melting eye."
        *   **Imagery:** Extends the visual image, now focusing on individual flowers and their dewy appearance. The "melting eye" suggests sorrow and pain.

*   **"Even so the maid with swelling drops gan wet"**
    *   *Literal Meaning:* In the same way, the maid (Lucrece's servant) began to wet her own eyes with swelling tears. "Gan" is an archaic form of "began."
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Transition:** "Even so" connects the previous imagery to the maid's reaction.
        *   **Alliteration:** "Swelling" and "swelling" could be considered an example as it creates a gentle consonance within the line, drawing attention to the abundance of tears.

*   **"Her circled eyne, enforced by sympathy"**
    *   *Literal Meaning:* Her round eyes, filled with tears, were caused by the sympathy she felt. "Eyne" is an archaic word for eyes.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Archaism:** The use of "eyne" adds a formal and somewhat distanced tone.
        *   **Word Choice:** "Enforced" emphasizes the involuntary nature of her tears; she cannot help but weep.

*   **"Of those fair suns set in her mistress' sky,"**
    *   *Literal Meaning:* This sympathy stemmed from the beautiful eyes (suns) of her mistress (Lucrece) having been dimmed by tragedy (the "sunset"). The "sky" is Lucrece's face.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Metaphor:** Lucrece's eyes are compared to "fair suns," representing their beauty and radiance.
        *   **Metaphor:** Lucrece's face is compared to "sky", emphasising the vastness of her character.
        *   **Euphemism:** "Set" is a gentle way of referring to the loss of Lucrece's light and joy due to the rape.
        *   **Conceit:** An extended metaphor that continues from line to line.

*   **"Who in a salt-waved ocean quench their light,"**
    *   *Literal Meaning:* These eyes, like suns, are now drowning in a "salt-waved ocean" of tears.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Metaphor:** The tears are a "salt-waved ocean," emphasizing their vastness and bitterness.
        *   **Imagery:** Continues the vivid visual of drowning or being extinguished.

*   **"Which makes the maid weep like the dewy night."**
    *   *Literal Meaning:* This situation (Lucrece's sorrow) causes the maid to weep, just as the night weeps with dew.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Simile:** The maid's weeping is compared to the "dewy night," completing the circle of comparison started in the first line.
        *   **Personification:** Continues to present nature as capable of feeling.

**Overall Meaning and Interpretation:**

This stanza describes the maid's reaction to Lucrece's despair, but it does so indirectly, through a series of extended comparisons to nature. The dominant image is that of a weeping world. The setting sun, dewy flowers, and dewy night all mirror the maid's sorrow.

The stanza uses the imagery of "suns" (Lucrece's eyes) being extinguished or drowned in a "salt-waved ocean" of tears to convey the intensity of Lucrece's suffering. The maid's tears are a direct result of her empathy for her mistress, demonstrating the powerful connection between them.

The use of metaphors and similes creates a sense of universal grief. Lucrece's tragedy is not just a personal one; it is reflected in the very fabric of the natural world. The maid's weeping is a natural response to the violation and the consequent dimming of Lucrece's light.

The archaic language adds a layer of formality and distance, which, paradoxically, can also heighten the sense of tragedy by giving it a timeless quality. This is a scene of profound sorrow and empathy, beautifully rendered through elaborate figurative language.
