# Stanza 61 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
As the grim lion fawneth o'er his prey,
Sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied,
So o'er this sleeping soul doth Tarquin stay,
His rage of lust by gazing qualified;
Slack'd, not suppress'd; for standing by her side,
His eye, which late this mutiny restrains,
Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins:
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"As the grim lion fawneth o'er his prey,"**
    *   **Meaning:** This line presents a simile. Just as a fierce lion, after a kill, might affectionately (or perhaps possessively) nuzzle its prey. The word "grim" emphasizes the lion's inherent ferocity. "Fawneth" suggests a deceptive tenderness.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Simile (using "as"), imagery.

*   **"Sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied,"**
    *   **Meaning:** The lion's intense hunger is now temporarily satisfied because it has successfully hunted and killed its prey. The "conquest" implies a struggle and victory.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Alliteration ("Sharp, satisfied"), imagery.

*   **"So o'er this sleeping soul doth Tarquin stay,"**
    *   **Meaning:** This completes the simile. Tarquin, like the lion, stands (or perhaps hovers) over Lucrece's sleeping body. The phrase "sleeping soul" is significant. It suggests Lucrece's innocence and vulnerability; her soul is at rest, unaware of the danger.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Simile (continuation), metaphor (soul as a symbol of innocence), inversion ("doth Tarquin stay" instead of "Tarquin doth stay").

*   **"His rage of lust by gazing qualified;"**
    *   **Meaning:** Tarquin's intense lust, his "rage," is somewhat lessened or calmed ("qualified") simply by looking at Lucrece. The act of gazing provides a temporary respite from his overwhelming desire.  "Qualified" doesn't mean completely eliminated, just tempered.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Metaphor (lust as a "rage"), alliteration ("rage by").

*   **"Slack'd, not suppress'd; for standing by her side,"**
    *   **Meaning:**  The lust is not gone, just lessened and lingering. This line emphasizes that the act of gazing has only weakened, not eliminated, his desire.  He is still standing very close to her.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Antithesis ("slack'd, not suppressed"), repetition.

*   **"His eye, which late this mutiny restrains,"**
    *   **Meaning:** Tarquin's eye, which only moments ago helped to control (restrain) his internal "mutiny" (the rebellion of his lustful desires against his reason). "Mutiny" is a powerful word, suggesting a violent uprising within him.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Metaphor ("mutiny" for inner turmoil), personification (giving the eye the ability to restrain).

*   **"Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins:"**
    *   **Meaning:** However, now the very same eye, through continued looking, is actually inciting a greater internal rebellion and stirring his blood (veins) to a higher degree of passion. The "greater uproar" indicates that his lust is building again, becoming even stronger than before.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Metaphor ("uproar" for intensified lust), personification (veins being tempted).

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza paints a vivid picture of Tarquin's internal struggle. He is depicted as a predator, like a lion, initially calmed by the mere proximity of his desired victim. However, the stanza makes it clear that this calm is only temporary and deceptive. The act of looking at Lucrece, which initially offered a brief respite from his lust, ultimately intensifies it, making his desire even more uncontrollable. The stanza highlights the dangerous power of temptation and the fragile nature of self-control in the face of overwhelming desire. It foreshadows Tarquin's inevitable descent into the act of rape.

**Key Literary Devices Summary:**

*   **Simile:** The primary device is the extended simile comparing Tarquin to a lion.
*   **Metaphor:** Lust is described as a "rage" and a "mutiny." The "sleeping soul" is a metaphorical representation of Lucrece's innocence.
*   **Personification:** Tarquin's eye is given the power to restrain and then tempt his veins.
*   **Imagery:** The stanza is rich in vivid imagery, evoking the predatory nature of Tarquin and the vulnerability of Lucrece.
*   **Alliteration:** Used sparingly but effectively ("Sharp satisfied," "rage by").
*   **Antithesis:** "Slack'd, not suppress'd" emphasizes the incomplete nature of Tarquin's control.
*   **Inversion:** "doth Tarquin stay" to fit the meter.

The stanza is a masterclass in psychological portrayal, showing the internal conflict and the escalating desire that will lead to the tragic act. It establishes Tarquin as a figure driven by base desires, ultimately unable to control his impulses.
