# Stanza 90 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
'Hast thou command? by him that gave it thee,
From a pure heart command thy rebel will:
Draw not thy sword to guard iniquity,
For it was lent thee all that brood to kill.
Thy princely office how canst thou fulfil,
When, pattern'd by thy fault, foul sin may say,
He learn'd to sin, and thou didst teach the way?
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down stanza 90 of Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* line by line and then analyze the overall meaning and literary devices.

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"Hast thou command? by him that gave it thee,"**
    *   **Meaning:** Do you hold a position of authority (command)? Remember the one who granted you that power. This line immediately establishes the speaker (Lucrece, likely) as confronting Tarquin about his abuse of power.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Rhetorical question, emphasis on the source of power.

*   **"From a pure heart command thy rebel will:"**
    *   **Meaning:** Use the good intentions you should have as the basis of your authority, to take control of your disobedient desires (rebel will). Your desires are in rebellion against good reason.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Juxtaposition (pure heart vs. rebel will), personification (will is "rebel").

*   **"Draw not thy sword to guard iniquity,"**
    *   **Meaning:** Do not use your power (represented by the sword) to protect or enable wickedness. Your sword should not be used to defend evil actions.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Metaphor (sword represents power and authority), personification (Iniquity needs guarding)

*   **"For it was lent thee all that brood to kill."**
    *   **Meaning:** Because that power was given to you to destroy and eradicate evil, not to protect it. Your authority should be used to suppress wickedness. The use of "brood" suggests a multitude of sins, implying that unchecked evil will reproduce.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Metaphor (brood=evil), alliteration with 'brood' and 'kill'

*   **"Thy princely office how canst thou fulfil,"**
    *   **Meaning:** How can you possibly perform the duties and responsibilities of your royal position.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Rhetorical question.

*   **"When, pattern'd by thy fault, foul sin may say,"**
    *   **Meaning:** When, because of your sin, evil can use you as an example and claim that it was inspired by you. Other people could be motivated to be evil because of what Tarquin has done.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Personification (sin can speak), imagery of "pattern" or model.

*   **"He learn'd to sin, and thou didst teach the way?"**
    *   **Meaning:** Will it be said that others learned to sin from you, that you demonstrated the path of sin?
    *   **Literary Devices:** Rhetorical question, direct address, cause-and-effect logic.

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza is a powerful condemnation of Tarquin's abuse of power. Lucrece argues that he is betraying the very foundation of his authority by using it to perpetrate evil rather than suppress it. She highlights the corrupting influence of his actions, emphasizing that he is not just committing a personal sin but setting a dangerous example that could lead others astray. The core argument is: *Power comes with responsibility, and to use power for evil is a profound violation of that trust. It also opens the door for more sin to spread*.

**Key Literary Devices Across the Stanza:**

*   **Rhetorical Questions:** Dominate the stanza, challenging Tarquin and forcing him to confront the implications of his actions.
*   **Metaphor:** The "sword" as a symbol of authority, "brood" of evil.
*   **Personification:** Giving human qualities to abstract concepts like "will" and "sin."
*   **Juxtaposition:** Contrasting "pure heart" with "rebel will" to highlight the internal conflict.
*   **Imagery:** Vivid descriptions that appeal to the senses, contributing to the emotional intensity.
*   **Alliteration:** Repetition of the 'b' sound and 'k' sound in line 4.

The stanza is a complex and carefully constructed argument, using rhetorical skill and powerful imagery to expose Tarquin's moral failing and the far-reaching consequences of his actions. It sets the stage for Lucrece's tragic response.
