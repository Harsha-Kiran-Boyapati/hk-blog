# Stanza 19 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
As one of which doth Tarquin lie revolving
The sundry dangers of his will's obtaining;
Yet ever to obtain his will resolving,
Though weak-built hopes persuade him to abstaining:
Despair to gain doth traffic oft for gaining;
And when great treasure is the meed proposed,
Though death be adjunct, there's no death supposed.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
This stanza from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* depicts Tarquin's internal conflict as he weighs the risks and rewards of raping Lucrece. Let's break it down line by line:

* **"As one of which doth Tarquin lie revolving / The sundry dangers of his will's obtaining;"**  This opens with a simile ("As one of which"), comparing Tarquin to someone wrestling with a difficult decision. He is "revolving" (considering) the various ("sundry") dangers associated with fulfilling his lustful "will" (his desire to rape Lucrece).  This sets up the internal struggle as the central theme.

* **"Yet ever to obtain his will resolving,"** Despite recognizing the dangers, Tarquin remains steadfast ("ever") in his resolve ("resolving") to achieve his goal.  This highlights his stubbornness and determination, even in the face of potential consequences.

* **"Though weak-built hopes persuade him to abstaining:"**  Here, Shakespeare introduces the counterforce: "weak-built hopes" represent the rational part of Tarquin's mind suggesting he should refrain ("abstaining").  These hopes are described as "weak-built" to emphasize their fragility and inability to truly counter his powerful desire.  The use of "persuade" suggests a struggle, not a complete victory of reason.

* **"Despair to gain doth traffic oft for gaining;"**  This line presents a paradox. "Despair to gain" ‚Äì the despair of *not* achieving his goal ‚Äì paradoxically becomes a motivator for achieving it ("doth traffic oft for gaining").  The desperation of failure fuels his determination.  "Traffic" implies a calculated exchange, suggesting a cynical acceptance of risk for reward.

* **"And when great treasure is the meed proposed,"**  This line introduces the "treasure" ‚Äì the sexual conquest of Lucrece ‚Äì as the prize ("meed") Tarquin desires.  The phrasing elevates the act to something of immense value in his warped perspective.

* **"Though death be adjunct, there's no death supposed."** This is the climax of the stanza.  Even though death ("death be adjunct") is a potential consequence ("adjunct"), Tarquin dismisses it ("there's no death supposed").  He doesn't actively *want* to die, but the possibility of death is outweighed by the desired "treasure."  The word "supposed" implies a willful ignorance or denial of the potential consequences.


**Literary Devices:**

* **Simile:** "As one of which doth Tarquin lie revolving..."
* **Personification:** "Despair to gain doth traffic oft for gaining" (Despair is given the human action of "trafficing").
* **Paradox:** The central idea of despair motivating action is a paradox.
* **Antithesis:** The contrasting ideas of "obtaining" and "abstaining" create antithesis.
* **Internal Conflict:** The stanza vividly portrays Tarquin's internal struggle between desire and reason.


**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza portrays Tarquin's ruthless pursuit of his lustful desire. He is fully aware of the potential dangers, but his powerful craving and the perceived value of the prize overshadow any rational concerns. His decision-making process is driven by a desperate determination and a calculated willingness to accept even death as a potential consequence. The stanza masterfully showcases the corrupting influence of unchecked desire and the psychological mechanisms that justify morally reprehensible actions.  Shakespeare uses the internal monologue to highlight the chilling logic of a rapist, where the potential reward blinds him to the profound wrong he is about to commit.
