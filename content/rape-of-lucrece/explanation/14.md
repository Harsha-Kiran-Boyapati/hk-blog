# Stanza 14 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
For that he colour'd with his high estate,
Hiding base sin in plaits of majesty;
That nothing in him seem'd inordinate,
Save something too much wonder of his eye,
Which, having all, all could not satisfy;
But, poorly rich, so wanteth in his store,
That, cloy'd with much, he pineth still for more.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
This stanza from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* focuses on Tarquin's deceptive nature and insatiable desires. Let's break down each line:

* **"For that he colour'd with his high estate,"**  This opens by stating a *reason* for the later consequences.  "Colour'd" means disguised or masked. Tarquin's high social standing ("high estate") allowed him to conceal his evil intentions.  This is a metaphor ‚Äì his position acts as a cosmetic cover for his true nature.

* **"Hiding base sin in plaits of majesty;"**  This continues the metaphor. "Base sin" refers to his inherent wickedness, specifically his lust and impending rape.  "Plaits of majesty" suggests the elaborate and seemingly flawless folds of regal attire and bearing.  The image is one of carefully constructed deception, where wickedness is hidden beneath the outward appearance of power and dignity.  This is another metaphor.

* **"That nothing in him seem'd inordinate,"**  This highlights the effectiveness of Tarquin's disguise.  To onlookers, nothing about him appeared excessive or out of control.  He presented a flawless image of composure and nobility.  "Inordinate" means excessive or immoderate.

* **"Save something too much wonder of his eye,"**  This is the crucial exception to his seemingly perfect fa√ßade.  "Too much wonder" describes the intense, almost unsettling gaze in his eyes, which hints at his inner depravity.  The "wonder" here is not admiration, but something awe-inspiring in a disturbing way.  This line uses *personification* by giving his eyes an overwhelming quality.

* **"Which, having all, all could not satisfy;"**  This line explains the consequence of his inner turmoil. Despite possessing everything ‚Äì power, wealth, status ‚Äì Tarquin remains unsatisfied.  This reveals his insatiable lust as a deep-seated problem, not a mere fleeting desire.  This uses *pleonasm* (repetition for emphasis) "all...all".

* **"But, poorly rich, so wanteth in his store,"**  This line presents a paradox.  "Poorly rich" is an oxymoron, highlighting the irony of his situation.  Despite material wealth ("store"), he's spiritually impoverished. He lacks inner peace and contentment.

* **"That, cloy'd with much, he pineth still for more."**  This concludes the stanza by summarizing Tarquin's condition. "Cloy'd" means surfeited or overwhelmed.  Despite having more than enough to satisfy any reasonable person, he remains consumed by an unquenchable desire, "pineth still for more". This reveals his addiction to power and lust.

**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza portrays Tarquin as a master of deception, concealing his base desires beneath the veneer of his high social standing.  His insatiable lust, however, betrays him, manifested in the unsettling intensity of his gaze. The stanza establishes a key theme of the poem: the destructive nature of unchecked ambition and desire, and how outward appearances can mask inner corruption.  The use of metaphors, oxymorons, and personification create a vivid and psychologically insightful portrait of a deeply flawed character.  The concluding lines establish his insatiable nature as the underlying cause of the tragedy to come.
