# Stanza 254 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
By this starts Collatine as from a dream,
And bids Lucretius give his sorrow place;
And then in key-cold Lucrece‚Äô bleeding stream
He falls, and bathes the pale fear in his face,
And counterfeits to die with her a space;
Till manly shame bids him possess his breath,
And live to be revenged on her death.
```

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza vividly portrays Collatine's immediate reaction to Lucrece's suicide.  Initially, he is stunned, then overwhelmed with grief and perhaps even a sense of guilt.  He acts as though he will die as well, overwhelmed by the tragedy. However, the "manly shame" associated with his helplessness and the lack of vengeance on the rapist (Tarquin) forces him to regain control and resolve to live. He embraces the need for revenge as his primary purpose. It marks a crucial turning point, showing the shift from despair to a determined resolve. It sets the stage for the action that will follow, the pursuit of justice, and ultimately, the fall of the Roman monarchy.

**Key Literary Devices and their significance:**

*   **Simile ("as from a dream"):** Emphasizes Collatine's initial disorientation and shock.
*   **Descriptive Adjective ("key-cold"):** Creates a visceral image of death, and symbolizes the end of life.
*   **Metaphor ("bleeding stream"):** Intensifies the horror and provides a visual image of Lucrece's fatal wound.
*   **Personification ("shame bids"):** Allows Shakespeare to personify and dramatize shame, a powerful emotion that drives Collatine's actions.
*   **Imagery:** The stanza is rich with vivid imagery, such as "key-cold Lucrece' bleeding stream" and "bathes the pale fear." This makes the scene incredibly affecting.

The stanza is a powerful and succinct summary of Collatine's psychological journey from shock and grief to a resolute commitment to vengeance.
