# Stanza 226 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
Which all this time hath overslipped her thought,
That she with painted images hath spent,
Being from the feeling of her own grief brought
By deep surmise of others‚Äô detriment,
Losing her woes in shows of discontent.
It easeth some, though none it ever cured,
To think their dolour others have endured.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down Stanza 226 of Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* line by line and then discuss the overall meaning and literary devices.

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"Which all this time hath overslipped her thought,"**
    *   **Meaning:** This refers to Lucrece‚Äôs immediate reaction after the rape where she has been obsessing with imagined imagery rather than directly processing her trauma. The trauma of the rape has been present in her mind the whole time, but her *thought* (conscious awareness, focus) has bypassed or "overslipped" the direct reality of it.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Suggests how the mind can try to avoid facing harsh reality

*   **"That she with painted images hath spent,"**
    *   **Meaning:** Lucrece has been focusing her attention on "painted images." These are not literal paintings, but rather vivid mental pictures. In the context of the poem, these images are her memories and reflections on other figures in the tapestry in her room, like Hecuba grieving over her lost family in the Trojan War. She is using these images as a way to distract herself from the horror.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Metaphor* (the "painted images" are mental pictures). Suggests the power of art and imagination to provide escape.

*   **"Being from the feeling of her own grief brought"**
    *   **Meaning:** She is deliberately *bringing* herself away from directly experiencing her own grief. She is consciously, or perhaps semi-consciously, diverting her attention.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Reinforces the idea of avoidance.

*   **"By deep surmise of others‚Äô detriment,"**
    *   **Meaning:** This line tells us *how* she's diverting her attention. She's doing it through "deep surmise of others' detriment." "Surmise" means guessing or conjecturing, and "detriment" means harm or suffering. So, she is deeply imagining, thinking about, and empathizing with the suffering of others.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Alliteration* (deep, detriment). Emphasis on the effort Lucrece is putting into thinking about other's suffering.

*   **"Losing her woes in shows of discontent."**
    *   **Meaning:** By focusing on the suffering of others, she manages to temporarily "lose" (or at least suppress) her own woes. She expresses "shows of discontent" ‚Äì outward displays of unhappiness or dissatisfaction ‚Äì about the situations of others. In other words, she is *acting* distraught about the plight of Hecuba or other tragic figures, as a way to avoid truly grappling with her own tragedy.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Paradox* (losing her woes in *shows*). It's a paradox because she is outwardly expressing unhappiness while inwardly trying to avoid feeling it.

*   **"It easeth some, though none it ever cured,"**
    *   **Meaning:** This is a general statement about the human condition. Focusing on the troubles of others can provide temporary relief ("easeth") from one's own suffering, even though it doesn't offer a true, lasting solution ("cured").
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Aphorism* (a general truth or observation about life, expressed concisely). Highlights the universal tendency for individuals to seek comfort in the misfortunes of others, albeit without achieving complete healing.

*   **"To think their dolour others have endured."**
    *   **Meaning:** It can be comforting to know that others have experienced similar pain ("dolour"). The knowledge that one is not alone in suffering can be a source of solace.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Consonance* (think, their). Reinforces the idea of shared experiences.

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza explains Lucrece's initial reaction to the rape: a form of psychological defense mechanism. Instead of confronting the full horror of her experience directly, she initially diverts her attention by focusing on the suffering of others, particularly as depicted in the "painted images" (the tapestry) in her room. She finds a temporary, superficial solace in considering the pain endured by others, but the stanza also acknowledges that this is a temporary fix, not a lasting cure. Shakespeare is making a broader observation about human nature - how humans often avoid painful truths by finding distractions or rationalizations in the suffering of others, even though it ultimately doesn't truly heal them. This suggests a complex psychological understanding of trauma.

**Key Literary Devices Used:**

*   **Metaphor:** "Painted images" representing mental pictures/reflections.
*   **Aphorism:** "It easeth some, though none it ever cured, / To think their dolour others have endured."
*   **Paradox:** "Losing her woes in shows of discontent."
*   **Alliteration:** "Deep, detriment"
*   **Consonance:** "Think, their"
