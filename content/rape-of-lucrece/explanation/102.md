# Stanza 102 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
And then with lank and lean discolour'd cheek,
With heavy eye, knit brow, and strengthless pace,
Feeble Desire, all recreant, poor, and meek,
Like to a bankrupt beggar wails his case:
The flesh being proud, Desire doth fight with Grace,
For there it revels; and when that decays,
The guilty rebel for remission prays.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down Stanza 102 of Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece*, line by line, and then discuss the overall meaning:

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"And then with lank and lean discolour'd cheek,"**
    *   *Breakdown:*  "And then" connects this to the preceding narrative. "Lank and lean discolour'd cheek" describes the physical appearance of a person. "Lank" means thin and drooping, "lean" means thin and lacking flesh. "Discolour'd" implies paleness, sickness, or loss of natural color.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Alliteration:**  "Lank and lean" emphasizes the physical deterioration.
        *   **Imagery:**  Creates a vivid image of someone looking ill or weakened.

*   **"With heavy eye, knit brow, and strengthless pace,"**
    *   *Breakdown:*  Continues describing physical signs of suffering. "Heavy eye" suggests sadness, fatigue, or guilt. "Knit brow" indicates worry, frustration, or anger. "Strengthless pace" means a weak or faltering walk.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Imagery:**  Adds to the picture of physical and emotional distress.
        *   **Asyndeton:** The lack of conjunctions speeds up the description, emphasizing the number of negative attributes.

*   **"Feeble Desire, all recreant, poor, and meek,"**
    *   *Breakdown:*  Here, Shakespeare personifies Desire. "Feeble Desire" suggests that the person's passions are weakened. "Recreant" means cowardly or disloyal (to what is right). "Poor" and "meek" further emphasize Desire's diminished state and humility.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Personification:**  Giving human qualities to "Desire."
        *   **Tricolon:**  The series of three adjectives ("recreant, poor, and meek") provides emphasis.

*   **"Like to a bankrupt beggar wails his case:"**
    *   *Breakdown:*  This is a simile comparing Desire to a "bankrupt beggar" who is lamenting their situation. "Bankrupt" means financially ruined. "Wails his case" means complaining loudly and sorrowfully about their situation. This amplifies the sense of loss and suffering.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Simile:**  Uses "like to" to draw a comparison.
        *   **Imagery:**  Creates a visual of a desperate beggar.

*   **"The flesh being proud, Desire doth fight with Grace,"**
    *   *Breakdown:*  Explains the internal conflict. "The flesh being proud" refers to the physical body and its sensual desires, implying arrogance and lust. "Desire doth fight with Grace" suggests a struggle between base impulses and moral goodness or divine favor.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Personification:**  "Desire" and "Grace" are treated as combatants.
        *   **Abstract Concepts as Characters:**  Desire and Grace symbolize the internal moral struggle.

*   **"For there it revels; and when that decays,"**
    *   *Breakdown:*  "For there it revels" refers to the "flesh" and suggests that the physical desires are initially dominant and enjoy themselves. "And when that decays" signifies that this physical dominance is not sustainable.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Metaphor:**  "Revels" suggests a wild celebration, implying that the physical desires are unrestrained.

*   **"The guilty rebel for remission prays."**
    *   *Breakdown:*  "The guilty rebel" refers to the weakened Desire, now recognizing its wrongdoings. "For remission prays" means it begs for forgiveness. This highlights the repentance and remorse that follows the indulgence of sinful desires.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Metaphor:**  Desire as a "rebel" reinforces the idea of a violation of moral boundaries.

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza describes the aftermath of giving in to lust or unchecked desire. It paints a picture of the physical and emotional consequences, using the personification of "Desire" to explore the internal conflict that arises. Initially, the "flesh" is proud and dominant, reveling in its desires. However, this state is unsustainable, and eventually, the individual (or "Desire") experiences remorse and seeks forgiveness ("remission"). The stanza highlights the cyclical nature of temptation, indulgence, and regret, emphasizing the struggle between physical desires and moral conscience. It also illustrates the debilitating effect of guilt and the desire for redemption. Essentially, it's a mini-allegory of sin, temptation, and repentance, showing the toll that immoral actions take on a person.
