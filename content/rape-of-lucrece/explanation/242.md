## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down Stanza 242 of Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* piece by piece and then discuss its overall meaning.

**Breakdown of each line:**

*   **"But ere I name him, you fair lords," quoth she:**
    *   "But ere I name him" - This means "But before I tell you his name..." It creates suspense and emphasizes the gravity of Lucrece's situation.
    *   "you fair lords" - This is a direct address to the noblemen who have come to her side with her husband, Collatine. "Fair" is used here in the sense of noble and honorable.
    *   "quoth she" - This is an archaic way of saying "said she." It's a common device in narrative poetry to indicate the speaker.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Direct Address* (to the lords).

*   **"Speaking to those that came with Collatine,"**
    *   This line clarifies who Lucrece is addressing. It's important to note that her husband is present, which adds to the drama and weight of her words.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *None*

*   **"Shall plight your honourable faiths to me,"**
    *   "Shall plight your honourable faiths" - This means "You must pledge your honorable promises/oaths." "Plight" suggests a solemn commitment. "Honourable faiths" reinforces the idea that she is speaking to men of high standing and expects them to act according to their principles.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Alliteration* of "faiths" and "fair" (although 'fair' is in the previous line).

*   **"With swift pursuit to venge this wrong of mine;"**
    *   "With swift pursuit" - She wants them to act quickly. Urgency is key.
    *   "to venge this wrong of mine" - She wants them to avenge the wrong that has been done to her, namely, the rape. This line clearly states her desire for revenge.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Alliteration* of "swift pursuit".

*   **"For ‚Äôtis a meritorious fair design"**
    *   "For 'tis a meritorious fair design" - This means "Because it is a worthy and just plan." "Meritorious" means deserving of praise or reward. "Fair" here means just or good. "Design" means purpose or plan.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Metaphor* (Revenge is portrayed as a 'design', highlighting its planned and deliberate nature).

*   **"To chase injustice with revengeful arms."**
    *   "To chase injustice" - To pursue and drive out injustice.
    *   "with revengeful arms" - This means through the use of force and violence motivated by revenge. It emphasizes the active and aggressive nature of the required response. "Arms" are not necessarily literal weapons but represent power and action.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Metaphor* (Injustice is described as something that can be 'chased'). *Personification* (Injustice is treated like an entity that can be chased)

*   **"Knights, by their oaths, should right poor ladies‚Äô harms.‚Äù**
    *   "Knights, by their oaths" - Knights are the epitome of chivalry, and they are bound by oaths to protect the weak and innocent.
    *   "should right poor ladies‚Äô harms" - This means that knights should correct the wrongs done to defenseless women. "Right" means to correct or set right. "Harms" refers to the injuries and damages she has suffered.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *None*

**Overall Meaning:**

In this stanza, Lucrece, before revealing the name of her attacker, demands a solemn oath from the noblemen present. She insists that they swear to avenge the wrong that has been done to her. She frames the act of revenge as a "meritorious fair design," implying that it is a just and honorable cause. She reminds them that as knights, they are sworn to protect and defend women, particularly those who have been harmed.

The stanza is a call to action. Lucrece uses powerful language to manipulate their sense of duty and honor. She presents her revenge as not just a personal matter, but as a moral imperative, a way to uphold the chivalric code and restore justice. The lines are charged with emotion and a sense of urgency, reflecting Lucrece's desperate desire for retribution. The stanza sets the stage for the revelation of Tarquin's name and the ensuing pursuit of justice (or, more accurately, revenge) by the noblemen. The emphasis on oaths and vows will be relevant later in the poem as it highlights the importance of keeping one's word.
