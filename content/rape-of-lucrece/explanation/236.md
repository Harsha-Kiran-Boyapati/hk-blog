# Stanza 236 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
‚ÄúMine enemy was strong, my poor self weak,
And far the weaker with so strong a fear.
My bloody judge forbade my tongue to speak;
No rightful plea might plead for justice there.
His scarlet lust came evidence to swear
That my poor beauty had purloined his eyes;
And when the judge is robbed, the prisoner dies.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down Stanza 236 from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* line by line, identifying literary devices, and then arrive at the overall meaning.

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"Mine enemy was strong, my poor self weak,"**

    *   **Meaning:** This line establishes the power imbalance between Lucrece and Tarquin.  "Mine enemy" clearly refers to Tarquin, and "my poor self" is Lucrece. It is a statement of simple, stark contrast.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Antithesis:** The contrasting words "strong" and "weak" emphasizes the vast difference in power.

*   **"And far the weaker with so strong a fear."**

    *   **Meaning:** Her fear amplifies her weakness. It's not just that she's physically weaker, but her terror further debilitates her.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Alliteration:** The repetition of the "w" sound ("weaker with") emphasizes her emotional state.

*   **"My bloody judge forbade my tongue to speak;"**

    *   **Meaning:** Tarquin, who acts as her oppressor (and effectively her judge), prevents her from defending herself. The phrase "bloody judge" highlights his merciless and violent nature.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Metaphor:** Tarquin is not literally a judge in a courtroom, but he assumes that role of judgement and power over her life.
        *   **Imagery:** "Bloody judge" evokes a vivid image of violence and injustice.

*   **"No rightful plea might plead for justice there."**

    *   **Meaning:** Justice is impossible in this situation. There is no opportunity for a fair hearing or for her innocence to be recognized.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Repetition:** "Plea plead" creates emphasis on the futility of her situation.
        *   **Alliteration:** The 'p' sound in 'plea plead' adds emphasis.

*   **"His scarlet lust came evidence to swear"**

    *   **Meaning:** Tarquin's overwhelming lust is presented as if it is providing evidence against her. "Scarlet" is often associated with sin, shame, and strong emotions like lust. His lust is now an active force that incriminates Lucrece.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Personification:** Lust is given the agency to "swear" against her, as if it were a witness.
        *   **Metaphor:** Lust is a metaphor for the false accusations and the twisted logic Tarquin is using.
        *   **Symbolism:** "Scarlet" symbolizes his passionate, overwhelming, and destructive desire.

*   **"That my poor beauty had purloined his eyes;"**

    *   **Meaning:** He is twisting the situation to make it seem as if Lucrece is responsible for his actions. He claims that her beauty stole his eyes, implying that she seduced him and is therefore to blame for his lust.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Irony:** This is a perversion of justice. He is shifting the blame onto the victim.
        *   **Metaphor:** Her beauty is presented as a thief, "purloining" his eyes.
        *   **Hyperbole:** Overexaggeration of the impact of her beauty.

*   **"And when the judge is robbed, the prisoner dies."**

    *   **Meaning:** This line sums up the complete corruption of justice. If the "judge" (Tarquin) feels wronged or robbed (by her beauty, as he claims), then the "prisoner" (Lucrece) is doomed. This is a stark statement about the lack of fairness and the inevitability of her destruction.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Metaphor:** The Judge refers to Tarquin and the prisoner refers to Lucrece
        *   **Aphorism/Proverb:** The line sounds like a well-known saying, but it's a warped version that reflects the unjust situation.

**Overall Meaning of the Stanza:**

This stanza describes the utter helplessness and injustice faced by Lucrece. It portrays a situation where power is absolute, and innocence offers no protection.  Tarquin, driven by his uncontrollable lust, has become both her attacker and her judge, making any possibility of justice impossible. He blames her for his own actions, twisting the truth to justify his violent crime. The stanza culminates in a chilling statement about the consequences of such corruption: in this perverse "court," the accused is condemned simply because the "judge" (Tarquin) believes he has been wronged (by her beauty, which is a complete fabrication). The overall message is one of deep despair and the tragic triumph of evil over good. It highlights how vulnerability and lack of power can lead to devastating outcomes when confronted with unchecked and perverse authority.
