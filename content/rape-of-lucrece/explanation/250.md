# Stanza 250 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
About the mourning and congealed face
Of that black blood a wat‚Äôry rigol goes,
Which seems to weep upon the tainted place;
And ever since, as pitying Lucrece‚Äô woes,
Corrupted blood some watery token shows,
And blood untainted still doth red abide,
Blushing at that which is so putrified.
```

    *   **"a wat‚Äôry rigol goes":** A circular or watery trace, a ring or halo. It refers to a watery fluid that has separated from the blood.
    *   This continues the visual imagery, suggesting a circle of clear fluid surrounding the dark, clotted blood.

*   **"Which seems to weep upon the tainted place;"**
    *   **"Which":** Referring to the "wat'ry rigol."
    *   **"seems to weep":** Personification. The watery circle appears to shed tears.
    *   **"upon the tainted place":** Over the spot where Lucrece was violated and suffered, adding a tone of sadness.

    *   **"Blushing":** Another instance of personification, as if the untainted blood is ashamed.

**Literary Devices:**

*   **Personification:**  Giving human qualities to inanimate objects or concepts (blood "mourning," "weeping," "blushing").
*   **Imagery:** Vivid descriptions appeal to the senses, especially sight (the visual description of the blood).
*   **Metaphor:** The blood itself becomes a metaphor for the purity of Lucrece and the corruption she suffers. The "tainted place" is a metaphor for the act of rape.
*   **Contrast:** The stanza contrasts the corrupted, "tainted" blood with the untainted, pure blood.
*   **Alliteration**: the repeating use of the "w" sound in the first three lines "About the mourning and congealed face / Of that black blood a wat‚Äôry rigol goes, / Which seems to weep upon the tainted place;"

**Overall Meaning and Interpretation:**

The stanza presents a highly visual and emotional depiction of the aftermath of Lucrece's rape, focusing on the physical state of her blood and the symbolic implications.  The clotted blood, described as having a "mourning" and "congealed face," is encircled by a "wat'ry rigol," which "seems to weep," creating an image of profound sorrow and loss. The stanza also uses personification to add to the overall sorrow of the poem.

The contrast between the "corrupted" blood and the "untainted" blood emphasizes the violation and the lasting impact of the trauma. The "blushing" of the untainted blood suggests shame and moral revulsion at the corruption. The visual description underscores the devastating effect of the act, turning the tragedy into something tangible and almost sentient. The blood itself becomes a physical manifestation of her loss of innocence and purity, the degradation of her body, and the moral corruption of her tormentor.
