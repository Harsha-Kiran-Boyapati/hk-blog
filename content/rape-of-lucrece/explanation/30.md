# Stanza 30 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
'Yea, though I die, the scandal will survive,
And be an eye-sore in my golden coat;
Some loathsome dash the herald will contrive,
To cipher me how fondly I did dote;
That my posterity, shamed with the note
Shall curse my bones, and hold it for no sin
To wish that I their father had not bin.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
This stanza from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* explores the lasting consequences of Lucrece's rape, specifically focusing on the shame and dishonor it will bring upon her and her lineage. Let's break it down line by line:

* **"Yea, though I die, the scandal will survive,"**  This line establishes the central theme: even death won't erase the shame.  The word "Yea" emphasizes the certainty and inevitability of this.  The contrast between Lucrece's mortality and the scandal's immortality is stark.

* **"And be an eye-sore in my golden coat;"** This is a powerful image.  "Golden coat" metaphorically represents Lucrece's high social standing and reputation, perhaps even her virtue and honor. The "eye-sore" ‚Äì a blemish, a stain ‚Äì signifies the scandal permanently marring her otherwise pristine image. This is a **metaphor** and also uses **imagery** to create a visual representation of shame.

* **"Some loathsome dash the herald will contrive,"** This refers to the family's coat of arms or lineage being defaced. The "herald" was the official responsible for recording and maintaining genealogical records and coats of arms. The "loathsome dash" represents the stain of the rape, a permanent alteration to her family's history.  "Contrive" suggests a deliberate, malicious act of marking this family with shame.

* **"To cipher me how fondly I did dote;"** This line uses the word "cipher" in the older sense of "to represent symbolically" or "to depict."  Lucrece's actions, or inaction, in the face of the rape, will be interpreted as foolish "dote" (extreme fondness or infatuation, here implying naivete or weakness) and the heraldic symbol will communicate that interpretation.  The rape is not only a scandal, but also evidence of a flaw in her character as interpreted by others.

* **"That my posterity, shamed with the note,"** This clarifies the consequence. Lucrece's descendants ("posterity") will bear the burden of this shame ("note," referring to the symbolic record of the scandal).

* **"Shall curse my bones, and hold it for no sin"**  This highlights the depth of the shame. Future generations will curse her for her perceived failings and even feel no guilt ("no sin") in doing so.

* **"To wish that I their father had not bin."**  This is the ultimate consequence:  Lucrece's descendants will wish she had never existed. It reveals the profound and lasting impact of her rape, extending beyond her lifetime to affect her family for generations to come.  This is a powerful statement about the destructive legacy of sexual violence.


**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza depicts the lasting and devastating effects of the rape on Lucrece's reputation and family legacy. It‚Äôs not just about the immediate trauma, but the indelible stain it leaves on her family name, passed down through generations.  Shakespeare uses vivid imagery, metaphors, and powerful language to emphasize the permanence of this shame and the tragic consequences for Lucrece and her posterity.  The stanza emphasizes the social repercussions of sexual assault, highlighting how victims often bear the brunt of societal judgment, even after their death.
