# Stanza 73 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
This said, he shakes aloft his Roman blade,
Which, like a falcon towering in the skies,
Coucheth the fowl below with his wings' shade,
Whose crooked beak threats if he mount he dies:
So under his insulting falchion lies
Harmless Lucretia, marking what he tells
With trembling fear, as fowl hear falcon's bells.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **Line 1: "This said, he shakes aloft his Roman blade,"**
    *   **Literal Meaning:** After saying this (presumably something threatening), Tarquin raises his Roman sword high in the air. "Aloft" means upwards or on high.
    *   **Analysis:** This is a simple, direct statement emphasizing the physical threat. The "Roman blade" reminds us of Tarquin's power, his status, and the potential for violence.
    *   **Literary Devices:** None apparent in this line.

*   **Line 2: "Which, like a falcon towering in the skies,"**
    *   **Literal Meaning:** The sword, as Tarquin holds it high, is compared to a falcon flying high up in the sky.
    *   **Analysis:** This is the beginning of an extended simile, a comparison using "like" or "as". The falcon imagery is crucial, as it represents power, aggression, and predatory dominance. The "towering" suggests superiority and control.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Simile*.

*   **Line 3: "Coucheth the fowl below with his wings' shade,"**
    *   **Literal Meaning:** The falcon's shadow cast by its wings, forces a bird (fowl) beneath him to crouch down. "Coucheth" means to crouch or lie down.
    *   **Analysis:** This continues the falcon simile. The "fowl" is vulnerable, overwhelmed by the falcon's presence. The shadow is not physical, but it is enough to cause the bird to submit.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Metaphor* (the shadow stands for a larger threat of Tarquin's influence), *Alliteration* ("Wings' shade").

*   **Line 4: "Whose crooked beak threatens if he mount he dies:"**
    *   **Literal Meaning:** The fowl's beak represents a futile defiance. If the bird tries to fly (mount), it will face deadly consequences.
    *   **Analysis:** This line reinforces the imbalance of power. The fowl may still threaten, but it's an empty threat. Resistance is futile. The threat of death further underlines the peril.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Personification* (the beak threatens).

*   **Line 5: "So under his insulting falchion lies,"**
    *   **Literal Meaning:** Just like the fowl under the falcon, Lucrece lies helpless beneath Tarquin's curved sword ("falchion"). "Insulting" suggests a cruel and humiliating display of power.
    *   **Analysis:** This line brings the simile back to Lucrece. She is the vulnerable fowl, and Tarquin is the falcon. The word "insulting" highlights the psychological and emotional violence alongside the physical threat.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Metaphor* (Lucrece is the fowl), *Alliteration* ("Falchion lies").

*   **Line 6: "Harmless Lucretia, marking what he tells,"**
    *   **Literal Meaning:** Lucrece, who is innocent ("harmless"), is paying attention to what Tarquin is saying.
    *   **Analysis:**  This line emphasizes Lucrece's innocence and passivity. She is simply listening to Tarquin‚Äôs threats, completely unarmed against his assault.
    *   **Literary Devices:** None apparent in this line.

*   **Line 7: "With trembling fear, as fowl hear falcon's bells."**
    *   **Literal Meaning:** Lucrece is trembling with fear, just as a bird would tremble upon hearing the bells attached to a falcon (used in falconry).
    *   **Analysis:** This is another simile, driving home the fear and vulnerability of Lucrece. The falcon's bells were used to locate the bird during hunts. The noise would cause other birds great anxiety.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Simile*, *Assonance* ("Fear, hear").

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza uses an extended simile involving a falcon and its prey to depict the power dynamics between Tarquin and Lucrece. Tarquin, wielding his sword, is likened to a falcon, a symbol of dominance and aggression. Lucrece is represented as the helpless fowl, trapped and terrified by Tarquin's threat. The stanza highlights Lucrece's vulnerability, her fear, and the overwhelming power Tarquin holds over her. The "insulting falchion" underscores the humiliation and cruelty inflicted upon her, making her impending rape all the more tragic. The extended metaphor perfectly encapsulates the helplessness and fear experienced by Lucrece while trapped in this situation. The final line seals the comparison, solidifying the image of Lucrece's utter terror.
