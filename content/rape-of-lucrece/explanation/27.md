## Original Stanza
```
Here pale with fear he doth premeditate
The dangers of his loathsome enterprise,
And in his inward mind he doth debate
What following sorrow may on this arise:
Then looking scornfully, he doth despise
His naked armour of still-slaughter'd lust,
And justly thus controls his thoughts unjust:

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
This stanza from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* depicts Tarquin's internal conflict before raping Lucrece. Let's break it down line by line:

* **"Here pale with fear he doth premeditate / The dangers of his loathsome enterprise,"**  This sets the scene.  "Pale with fear" uses vivid imagery to show Tarquin's apprehension, despite his intent. "Premeditate" emphasizes the conscious, planned nature of his actions, highlighting his guilt even before committing the act. "Loathsome enterprise" uses strong, negative diction to describe the rape, foreshadowing its repulsiveness.

* **"And in his inward mind he doth debate / What following sorrow may on this arise:"** This reveals Tarquin's awareness of potential consequences.  "Debate" suggests a struggle within his conscience. The phrase "following sorrow" foreshadows the devastating aftermath of his actions.  This is a form of **foreshadowing**.

* **"Then looking scornfully, he doth despise / His naked armour of still-slaughter'd lust,"** This shows a shift in Tarquin's mindset.  He attempts to dismiss his fear and guilt. "Looking scornfully" indicates a deliberate attempt to suppress his conscience.  The powerful metaphor, "naked armour of still-slaughter'd lust," is crucial. "Naked armour" paradoxically portrays his lust as a feeble defense, not a strength. "Still-slaughter'd lust" is an oxymoron‚Äîlust is presented as already having caused death (symbolically, morally) even before the rape itself.  This is a powerful **metaphor** and **oxymoron**.

* **"And justly thus controls his thoughts unjust:"** This line marks the climax of the internal conflict.  "Justly controls his thoughts unjust" is an ironic statement. Tarquin attempts to rationalize his evil intentions, claiming to exert control over his "unjust" thoughts, which further highlights the hypocrisy and self-deception at play. This is also an example of **irony**.


**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza portrays Tarquin's moment of internal conflict before the rape.  While he is aware of the potential dangers and moral implications of his actions, his self-justification and arrogant dismissal of his conscience ultimately lead him to proceed with his heinous plan. Shakespeare uses vivid imagery, powerful metaphors, and ironic phrasing to expose the hypocrisy and self-deception at the heart of Tarquin's evil. The stanza prepares the reader for the brutality to follow, highlighting Tarquin‚Äôs conscious decision to commit the act despite his own internal warnings. The language emphasizes the premeditation and cold calculation involved, making the subsequent act even more reprehensible.
