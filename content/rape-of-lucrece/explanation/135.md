# Stanza 135 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
'Time's glory is to calm contending kings,
To unmask falsehood and bring truth to light,
To stamp the seal of time in aged things,
To wake the morn and sentinel the night,
To wrong the wronger till he render right,
To ruinate proud buildings with thy hours,
And smear with dust their glittering golden towers;
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down stanza 135 of Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece*, analyzing each line and then offering an overall interpretation:

**Line-by-Line Analysis:**

*   **'Time's glory is to calm contending kings,'**
    *   **Analysis:** This line establishes the primary subject: Time. It declares that one of Time's most magnificent achievements (its "glory") is to pacify warring rulers. "Contending" kings are kings in conflict, battling for power or territory.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Personification (Time is given the ability to exert power)

*   **'To unmask falsehood and bring truth to light,'**
    *   **Analysis:** Time is depicted as a revealer of truth. Falsehoods, lies, and deceit are exposed by Time, while truth is brought into the open, becoming visible.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Metaphor (Falsehoods are masked), Personification (Time revealing truth)

*   **'To stamp the seal of time in aged things,'**
    *   **Analysis:** This line means that Time leaves its mark on everything as it ages. The "seal of time" could be wrinkles, decay, historical significance, or simply the inevitable changes that occur with age. "Aged things" refers to things that grow old, such as people or objects.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Metaphor (Seal of Time)

*   **'To wake the morn and sentinel the night,'**
    *   **Analysis:** Time governs the cycle of day and night. It "wakes the morn," meaning it brings about the morning, and it acts as a "sentinel" (guard) over the night, controlling its duration and perhaps ensuring its safety.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Personification (Time wakes), Metaphor (Sentinel)

*   **'To wrong the wronger till he render right,'**
    *   **Analysis:** This line speaks to Time's role in justice. Time, in its due course, will inflict suffering on those who commit wrongdoings ("wrong the wronger") until they make amends ("render right"). Justice, if not immediate, is eventually delivered.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Alliteration ("wrong the wronger"); Juxtaposition (wrong/right)

*   **'To ruinate proud buildings with thy hours,'**
    *   **Analysis:** Time is a force of destruction. Even the most impressive and magnificent structures ("proud buildings") are subject to Time's destructive power. Time, measured in hours, leads to the decay and downfall of even the most seemingly indestructible things.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Personification (Time possesses hours)

*   **'And smear with dust their glittering golden towers;'**
    *   **Analysis:** The final line continues the theme of Time's destructive power. The beautiful, "glittering golden towers" of these proud buildings are ultimately reduced to dust by time. The image emphasizes the transience of even the most opulent and impressive creations.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Imagery (visual, descriptive), Alliteration ("glittering golden")

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza presents Time as a complex and powerful force. It is not simply a neutral measurement of passing moments but an active agent that shapes the world. Time is a source of both good and bad. It brings peace, reveals truth, and ultimately delivers justice, but it also causes decay, destruction, and the inevitable downfall of even the most impressive achievements. The stanza emphasizes the transience of worldly power and beauty, reminding us that all things are subject to the relentless march of Time. The tone is somber and contemplative, reflecting the overall tragic nature of the poem.

In the context of *The Rape of Lucrece*, this stanza can be seen as a foreshadowing of the events to come. Tarquin's pride and lust will lead to Lucrece's rape and suicide, but ultimately, Time will bring about his downfall and the establishment of the Roman Republic. Time, in this context, is the ultimate judge and avenger.
