# Stanza 94 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
'Thou art,' quoth she, 'a sea, a sovereign king;
And, lo, there falls into thy boundless flood
Black lust, dishonour, shame, misgoverning,
Who seek to stain the ocean of thy blood.
If all these pretty ills shall change thy good,
Thy sea within a puddle's womb is hearsed,
And not the puddle in thy sea dispersed.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down Stanza 94 of Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* line by line, identify the literary devices, and then discuss the overall meaning.

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"Thou art,' quoth she, 'a sea, a sovereign king;"**
    *   **Meaning:** Lucrece is speaking to Tarquin. She directly addresses him, using strong metaphors. She declares that he is both a "sea" and a "sovereign king," both indicating immense power, vastness, and authority.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Metaphor:**  Tarquin *is* the sea and a king. There is no "like" or "as" (simile).
        *   **Apostrophe:**  Direct address to someone (Tarquin) who is present.
        *   **Juxtaposition:** Putting "sea" and "sovereign king" together emphasizes both his natural and political power.

*   **"And, lo, there falls into thy boundless flood"**
    *   **Meaning:** Lucrece continues the sea metaphor.  "Lo" is an archaic interjection meaning "look!" She says that something is falling into his "boundless flood," meaning his vast, powerful being (still referring to Tarquin).
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Continuing Metaphor:** Reinforces the "sea" imagery.
        *   **Archaism:** "Lo" adds a formal, elevated tone.

*   **"Black lust, dishonour, shame, misgoverning,"**
    *   **Meaning:**  These are the things falling into his "boundless flood."  They are negative forces: lust, dishonor, shame, and poor rule or leadership.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Personification:** These abstract concepts are presented as if they can physically "fall" into something.
        *   **Enumeration (List):** The listing of negative qualities intensifies the sense of corruption.
        *   **Alliteration:** The repetition of "shame" and "misgoverning" adds emphasis.

*   **"Who seek to stain the ocean of thy blood."**
    *   **Meaning:** These negative forces (lust, dishonour, shame, misgoverning) aim to corrupt his lineage or essence. The phrase "ocean of thy blood" suggests not just his lifeblood but also his entire heritage, character, and noble nature.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Metaphor:** Compares his heritage to an ocean of blood.
        *   **Personification:** Giving the abstract forces agency ("seek to stain").

*   **"If all these pretty ills shall change thy good,"**
    *   **Meaning:**  "Pretty ills" is an ironic and paradoxical phrase.  Lucrece calls the negative things "pretty", which is obviously the opposite of what they are. She proposes a hypothetical situation: *If* these seemingly insignificant evils (his lust) were to corrupt his inherent goodness.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Irony:** "Pretty ills" is ironic because they are far from pretty. It's a sarcastic understatement.
        *   **Alliteration:** The repetition of 'p' in "pretty" adds emphasis.

*   **"Thy sea within a puddle's womb is hearsed,"**
    *   **Meaning:** Continuing the "sea" metaphor, if Tarquin's good nature is corrupted by these "pretty ills," then his great, powerful being (the sea) will be confined and buried ("hearsed") within the insignificant container of a "puddle's womb." The "puddle's womb" represents the smallness and insignificance of the "ills" that are corrupting him.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Metaphor:** The sea (Tarquin's goodness) and the puddle's womb (the sin of lust).
        *   **Imagery:** Vivid contrast between the vast sea and the tiny puddle.
        *   **Personification:** The "puddle" has a womb (place of origin/holding).
        *   **Alliteration:** Repetition of 'w' in "womb" further emphasizes.

*   **"And not the puddle in thy sea dispersed."**
    *   **Meaning:** This line emphasizes the total corruption.  The implication is that *ordinarily*, a small puddle would be lost within a vast sea. But here, it's the *opposite*. The 'puddle' of sin will not simply disappear within him; rather, his entire being will be overtaken and confined by the 'puddle' of sin.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Inversion:** Reversal of the natural order (the puddle overwhelming the sea).
        *   **Continuing Metaphor:** Reinforces the sea/puddle imagery.

**Overall Meaning of the Stanza:**

Lucrece is powerfully warning Tarquin about the destructive nature of his lust. She uses the extended metaphor of the sea to represent his power, nobility, and essential goodness. She argues that if he succumbs to his "pretty ills" (his lust and dishonorable desires), these small but potent evils will not simply disappear within him; instead, they will consume and corrupt his entire being, burying his greatness within the confines of something small and insignificant. She emphasizes that his potential for greatness (his "sea") will be lost, swallowed by the "puddle" of his sinful actions. The stanza is a plea for him to resist temptation and preserve his honor, warning of the catastrophic consequences of succumbing to his lust. It is a vivid and dramatic portrayal of the struggle between good and evil within a person. She argues that his reputation, nobility and worth would be diminished significantly if he gave in to this lust.
