# Stanza 5 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
Beauty itself doth of itself persuade
The eyes of men without an orator;
What needeth then apologies be made,
To set forth that which is so singular?
Or why is Collatine the publisher
Of that rich jewel he should keep unknown
From thievish ears, because it is his own?
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Let's break down Shakespeare's stanza from *The Rape of Lucrece*, line by line:

* **Line 1: "Beauty itself doth of itself persuade / The eyes of men without an orator;"**  This line establishes the central idea. "Beauty itself" is personified ‚Äì it acts independently.  The phrase "doth of itself persuade" means beauty convinces or captivates without needing any help.  "The eyes of men" are the recipients of this persuasion, and "without an orator" highlights that beauty's power is inherent and needs no verbal argument or advocacy.  This is a powerful statement about the immediate and undeniable impact of beauty.

* **Line 2: "What needeth then apologies be made,"** This line poses a rhetorical question.  "Needeth" is an archaic form of "needs."  The question challenges the necessity of any justification or explanation for beauty.

* **Line 3: "To set forth that which is so singular?"** This line continues the rhetorical question. "Singular" here means exceptional, unique, extraordinary.  The question implies that something so uniquely beautiful needs no further explanation or defense.

* **Line 4: "Or why is Collatine the publisher / Of that rich jewel he should keep unknown"** This line introduces Collatine, Lucrece's husband, and shifts the focus to his actions.  Lucrece's beauty is likened to a "rich jewel," a metaphor emphasizing its preciousness and value.  The phrase "he should keep unknown" suggests that a truly precious thing should be guarded and kept private, implying a sense of discretion or even possessiveness.

* **Line 5: "From thievish ears, because it is his own?"** This line completes the rhetorical question, highlighting the paradoxical nature of Collatine's behavior.  "Thievish ears" represent those who would covet or exploit Lucrece's beauty.  The final question implies that Collatine's boasting about Lucrece's beauty is foolish because its very possession should be enough. The possession of something precious doesn't necessitate announcing it to the world.


**Literary Devices:**

* **Personification:** Beauty is given human qualities ("doth of itself persuade").
* **Metaphor:** Lucrece's beauty is compared to a "rich jewel."
* **Rhetorical Questions:** The stanza is built around a series of rhetorical questions, not seeking answers but emphasizing the inherent absurdity of Collatine's actions.
* **Antithesis:** There's a subtle antithesis between the inherent power of beauty and Collatine's unnecessary boasting.
* **Irony:**  The inherent beauty should be its own protection, but Collatine‚Äôs actions invite danger.


**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza criticizes Collatine for his boastful proclamation of Lucrece's beauty.  Shakespeare argues that beauty's power is self-evident and needs no advertisement.  By showing off Lucrece's beauty, Collatine unwittingly invites the very danger that ultimately leads to her rape. The stanza acts as foreshadowing and sets a critical tone toward Collatine's actions, subtly suggesting his naivet√© and the potentially disastrous consequences of his lack of discretion.  The inherent worth of something beautiful should not necessitate excessive, public display.  The private nature of beauty and its potential vulnerability are central themes introduced here.
