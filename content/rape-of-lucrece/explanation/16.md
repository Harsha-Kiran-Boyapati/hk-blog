# Stanza 16 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
He stories to her ears her husband's fame,
Won in the fields of fruitful Italy;
And decks with praises Collatine's high name,
Made glorious by his manly chivalry
With bruised arms and wreaths of victory:
Her joy with heaved-up hand she doth express,
And, wordless, so greets heaven for his success.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
This stanza from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* depicts the moment before the rape, establishing the idyllic happiness of Lucrece and highlighting the stark contrast that will follow. Let's break it down line by line:

* **"He stories to her ears her husband's fame,"**  This line introduces Tarquin, who begins to woo Lucrece by recounting the glories of her husband, Collatine.  "Stories" here means "tells tales" or "relates stories," subtly foreshadowing the deceptive nature of Tarquin's words.

* **"Won in the fields of fruitful Italy;"** This line specifies the location of Collatine's military victories, emphasizing the abundance and prosperity of Italy, which stands in stark contrast to the devastation about to occur.  "Fruitful Italy" is an example of **epithet**, a descriptive adjective that adds to the imagery.

* **"And decks with praises Collatine's high name,"** This continues the praise, using the metaphor of "decks" to imply lavish embellishment and admiration.  This is further emphasized by the following line.

* **"Made glorious by his manly chivalry"** This line directly praises Collatine's valor and knightly virtues, reinforcing the image of a perfect husband.  "Manly chivalry" is a **synecdoche**, using a part (chivalry) to represent the whole (Collatine's heroic qualities).

* **"With bruised arms and wreaths of victory:"** This line provides vivid imagery, depicting the physical signs of Collatine's military success.  "Bruised arms" represent the hard work and struggle involved, while "wreaths of victory" signify his triumph.  This is an example of **juxtaposition**, placing contrasting images (bruised arms and wreaths) to emphasize the struggle and reward.

* **"Her joy with heaved-up hand she doth express,"** This line shows Lucrece's reaction to Tarquin's words.  The physical act of raising her hand is a visual representation of her happiness and gratitude for her husband‚Äôs achievements.

* **"And, wordless, so greets heaven for his success."** This final line emphasizes Lucrece's silent prayer of thanks, highlighting her piety and devotion to her husband.  The wordlessness underscores the depth of her emotion, which is all the more poignant given the events to come.

**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza depicts a scene of domestic bliss and marital fidelity. Tarquin, through his flattery and skillful manipulation, exploits Lucrece's love and admiration for her husband to gain her trust and lower her defenses before committing his heinous act. The vivid descriptions of Collatine's glories and Lucrece's joyful response create a strong contrast with the impending violence and rape, making the subsequent violation even more shocking and impactful.  The use of various literary devices enhances the dramatic irony, allowing the reader to anticipate the tragedy while fully appreciating the serene moment described.  The stanza functions as a crucial setup, establishing the idyllic world that Tarquin is about to shatter.
