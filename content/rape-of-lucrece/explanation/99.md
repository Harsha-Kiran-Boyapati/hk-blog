# Stanza 99 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
But she hath lost a dearer thing than life,
And he hath won what he would lose again:
This forced league doth force a further strife;
This momentary joy breeds months of pain;
This hot desire converts to cold disdain:
Pure Chastity is rifled of her store,
And Lust, the thief, far poorer than before.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down stanza 99 from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* line by line:

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"But she hath lost a dearer thing than life,"**
    *   **Meaning:** Lucrece has lost something more valuable than her physical existence. This refers to her honor and chastity.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Hyperbole:** Exaggeration, as honor/chastity cannot be literally dearer than life itself. It is used to emphasize the importance of Lucrece's virtue in the societal context of the poem.

*   **"And he hath won what he would lose again:"**
    *   **Meaning:** Tarquin has gained something (Lucrece's body and temporary satisfaction), but it will ultimately lead to his downfall and he'll lose it again through shame, guilt, and eventually death.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Irony:** Tarquin thinks he has won, but his "victory" will actually destroy him.
        *   **Foreshadowing:** Hints at the negative consequences that will come to Tarquin.

*   **"This forced league doth force a further strife;"**
    *   **Meaning:** The forced union (the rape) will inevitably lead to more conflict and trouble. The rape is presented as not just a violation of a person, but also of the social and political order.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Alliteration:** Repetition of the 'f' sound for emphasis ("forced" and "further").
        *   **Metaphor:** The use of "league" represents the violent union, which is not a true bond, but a forced connection.

*   **"This momentary joy breeds months of pain;"**
    *   **Meaning:** The fleeting pleasure Tarquin experiences from the rape will result in extended suffering and sorrow for both him and Lucrece (and potentially Rome).
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Contrast:** Juxtaposes the brief "joy" with the extended "months of pain," highlighting the imbalance of the situation and the disproportionate consequences.

*   **"This hot desire converts to cold disdain:"**
    *   **Meaning:** Tarquin's passionate lust will transform into a feeling of disgust and contempt, both for himself and for Lucrece (perhaps, although more accurately, he will simply no longer desire her).
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Metaphor:** Compares emotions to temperature, highlighting the intensity of Tarquin's feelings and their subsequent shift.
        *   **Antithesis:** Opposite ideas are put together (hot vs. cold, desire vs. disdain).

*   **"Pure Chastity is rifled of her store,"**
    *   **Meaning:** Lucrece's virginity (her "store") has been stolen or violated.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Metaphor:** Chastity is personified and treated as a valuable possession that can be robbed.
        *   **Alliteration:** Repetition of the 'r' sound (rifled/her).

*   **"And Lust, the thief, far poorer than before."**
    *   **Meaning:** Even though Tarquin (lust) committed the act of theft, he is actually left worse off and impoverished by the experience. Lust is not fulfilling; it leaves one empty and degraded.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Personification:** Lust is given human qualities as a "thief."
        *   **Paradox:** Lust, which seeks to gain pleasure, ironically leaves the perpetrator "poorer."
        *   **Metaphor:** Lust is a "thief" because it steals something of value (Lucrece's honor) but provides no lasting fulfillment.

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza functions as a pivotal reflection on the consequences of the rape. It asserts that the act has resulted in a profound loss for Lucrece that outweighs physical life itself, while Tarquin's perceived victory is ultimately self-destructive. The forced violation creates a cycle of further conflict and misery, with the fleeting pleasure of lust giving way to long-term suffering and disgust. The stanza underscores the tragic irony of the situation: Tarquin, in attempting to enrich himself through the act, is left spiritually impoverished, while Lucrece's purity is irrevocably stolen. The stanza emphasizes the destructive nature of lust and the immense value placed on chastity in the context of the poem. The stanza ultimately reinforces the futility of Tarquin's actions and foreshadows the devastating repercussions that will follow, both for him and for Rome. It highlights that the true cost of the rape extends far beyond the immediate physical act.
