# Stanza 202 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
About him were a press of gaping faces,
Which seemed to swallow up his sound advice,
All jointly list‚Äôning, but with several graces,
As if some mermaid did their ears entice;
Some high, some low, the painter was so nice.
The scalps of many, almost hid behind,
To jump up higher seemed to mock the mind.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down stanza 202 of Shakespeare's "The Rape of Lucrece" line by line, then put it all together:

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"About him were a press of gaping faces,"**

    *   **Meaning:**  Around him (referring to a speaker, likely Tarquin who is being compared to a figure in a painting) was a large crowd of people with their mouths open. "Press" suggests a crowd pushing closely together.
    *   **Literary Devices:**  Imagery. The word "press" evokes a physical sense of crowding.

*   **"Which seemed to swallow up his sound advice,"**

    *   **Meaning:**  The gaping mouths gave the impression that they were eagerly consuming his wise counsel.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Metaphor:** The advice is not literally being swallowed. The image highlights the intense absorption of the audience.
        *   **Personification:** Faces can't swallow.

*   **"All jointly list‚Äôning, but with several graces,"**

    *   **Meaning:**  They were all listening together, but each person exhibited a different type of charm or attractiveness (in the way they were listening).
    *   **Literary Devices:**  Juxtaposition/Contrast. "Jointly" suggests unity, while "several graces" hints at individual distinctiveness.

*   **"As if some mermaid did their ears entice;"**

    *   **Meaning:**  Their rapt attention was so complete, it was as though they were being lured by the enchanting song of a mermaid.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Simile:** The "as if" construction makes it a simile. Compares the persuasive power of the speech to a mermaid's seductive song.
        *   **Allusion:** Mermaids are mythical creatures known for their captivating voices.

*   **"Some high, some low, the painter was so nice."**

    *   **Meaning:**  Some faces were positioned higher (in the painting), some lower; the painter was so skillful/precise in his depiction. "Nice" here means meticulous, careful.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Antithesis:** "Some high, some low" creates a balanced contrast.
        *   **Metonymy:** High and low refers to the placement of the faces.

*   **"The scalps of many, almost hid behind,"**

    *   **Meaning:**  The tops of many of their heads were partially hidden by the people in front of them.
    *   **Literary Devices:**  Imagery.

*   **"To jump up higher seemed to mock the mind."**

    *   **Meaning:**  The attempt of those in the back to appear taller seemed foolish, and perhaps almost deranged. The phrase "mock the mind" suggests that this ridiculous behavior is the result of the powerful persuasive speech that causes them to act illogically.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Personification:** The action of "jumping up higher" (motivated by vanity or a desire to be seen) is presented as something that "mocks the mind," imlying illogical or unreasonable behavior.

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza describes a crowd of people listening intently to a speaker who is being compared to a figure in a painting (possibly Tarquin himself or another persuasive orator). Their rapt attention is likened to being lured by a mermaid's song, emphasizing the speaker's powerful influence. The diversity in the crowd and their reactions, including the somewhat absurd attempts to be seen, highlight the persuasive power of the speaker's words. The image suggests that the speaker's advice is so captivating, it causes the listeners to lose some of their sense of reason, engaging in almost desperate attempts to absorb his message. The image of a "press of gaping faces" portrays the seductive and manipulative power of words, as the speaker is able to entice his audience in order to fulfill his own intentions. The stanza ultimately explores the theme of manipulation and the seductive power of persuasion. It also subtly comments on the human tendency to be easily swayed by rhetoric, even to the point of absurdity.
