# Stanza 97 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
This said, he sets his foot upon the light,
For light and lust are deadly enemies:
Shame folded up in blind concealing night,
When most unseen, then most doth tyrannize.
The wolf hath seized his prey, the poor lamb cries;
Till with her own white fleece her voice controll'd
Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down this chilling stanza from *The Rape of Lucrece* line by line and then discuss the overall meaning, highlighting the literary devices Shakespeare uses.

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"This said, he sets his foot upon the light,"**

    *   **Meaning:** After speaking (likely making threats or pronouncements of his intention), Tarquin physically extinguishes the light in the room. This is a deliberate and symbolic act.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Symbolism:** "Light" symbolizes purity, goodness, virtue, reason, and truth. Extinguishing it represents the deliberate suppression of these qualities in favor of darkness and evil.

*   **"For light and lust are deadly enemies:"**

    *   **Meaning:** This line provides the justification for his action. Lust cannot flourish in the presence of light, which exposes and judges its base nature. They are diametrically opposed forces.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Personification:** Lust is personified as an entity that has "enemies."
        *   **Antithesis:** Light and lust are presented as direct opposites, creating a stark contrast.

*   **"Shame folded up in blind concealing night,"**

    *   **Meaning:** Shame, the inevitable consequence of Tarquin's intended act, is now hidden and sheltered by the darkness of the night. The darkness allows him to act without being seen by others and prevents him from seeing the truth of his actions.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Personification:** Shame is personified as something that can be "folded up."
        *   **Imagery:** The image of "blind concealing night" creates a sense of secrecy, foreboding, and moral darkness.

*   **"When most unseen, then most doth tyrannize."**

    *   **Meaning:** The hidden and concealed nature of his actions only empowers him. The act will cause greater pain and shame when hidden away.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Paradox:** The idea that being "unseen" allows something to "tyrannize" more powerfully is a paradox. The lack of external restraint allows Tarquin's internal desires to run rampant.
        *   **Alliteration:** the "m" sound is repeated which highlights the line's meaning.

*   **"The wolf hath seized his prey, the poor lamb cries;"**

    *   **Meaning:** A vivid metaphor of predator and prey. Tarquin (the wolf) has captured Lucrece (the lamb). Her cries for help are now heard.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Metaphor:** Tarquin is compared to a wolf, representing his predatory and aggressive nature. Lucrece is compared to a lamb, symbolizing her innocence, vulnerability, and helplessness.
        *   **Imagery:** The imagery of the wolf seizing the lamb is visceral and evokes a sense of violence and helplessness.

*   **"Till with her own white fleece her voice controll'd"**

    *   **Meaning:**  Lucrece's own white robe (fleece), symbolic of her purity, is used to smother and silence her screams. This is a terrifying detail, highlighting her powerlessness.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Symbolism:** "White fleece" (her robe) continues to symbolize her purity, but now it ironically becomes an instrument of her silencing.
        *   **Imagery:** The image of the fleece stifling her voice is suffocating and emphasizes her loss of control.

*   **"Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:"**

    *   **Meaning:** Her cry of protest is trapped within her own mouth, a final image of her utter helplessness and the violation of her voice.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Metaphor:** "Entombs" suggests that her cry is buried alive, emphasizing the finality of her silencing.
        *   **Synecdoche:** "lips' sweet fold" is a synecdoche (part representing the whole), referring to her mouth but also to her entire being. The adjective "sweet" is ironic, highlighting the corruption of something pure.
        *   **Alliteration:** The 's' sound is repeated.

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza captures the precise moment when Tarquin's predatory intentions fully manifest and Lucrece's resistance is violently suppressed. The extinguishing of the light, the personification of shame hidden in the darkness, and the brutal metaphor of the wolf and the lamb create a sense of impending horror and the loss of innocence. The final lines, where Lucrece's own purity (symbolized by her white robe) becomes the instrument of her silencing, are particularly disturbing and underscore the tragedy of her situation. The stanza is a masterclass in creating tension, dread, and a sense of moral corruption through vivid imagery, symbolism, and personification. It prepares the reader for the inevitable and horrific act of rape that is to follow.
