# Stanza 243 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
At this request, with noble disposition
Each present lord began to promise aid,
As bound in knighthood to her imposition,
Longing to hear the hateful foe bewrayed.
But she, that yet her sad task hath not said,
The protestation stops. ‚ÄúO, speak,‚Äù quoth she,
‚ÄúHow may this forced stain be wiped from me?
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down Stanza 243 from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* line by line and then provide an overall interpretation, highlighting the literary devices:

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"At this request, with noble disposition"**
    *   Meaning: In response to Lucrece's plea (likely for revenge or assistance in seeking justice), the noblemen present were inclined to help. "Noble disposition" suggests they were inclined to act honorably and with compassion.
    *   Literary Devices: *Alliteration* of "noble" and "disposition" gives emphasis to the lords' characteristics.

*   **"Each present lord began to promise aid,"**
    *   Meaning: Every nobleman who was there started to offer his help to Lucrece.
    *   Literary Devices: None particularly stand out here, this is a straightforward statement of action.

*   **"As bound in knighthood to her imposition,"**
    *   Meaning: They felt obligated by their chivalric oaths and the moral duty that knighthood entailed to fulfill her demand or command (her "imposition"). The idea of "imposition" is somewhat interesting. It suggests that helping her isn't just a charitable act, but almost an obligation, something she is laying upon them because of the horror inflicted upon her.
    *   Literary Devices: *Allusion* to the code of *Knighthood* that governed their behavior and actions.

*   **"Longing to hear the hateful foe bewrayed."**
    *   Meaning: They eagerly wanted to hear the identity of her attacker (Tarquin) revealed, so that justice could be served. "Bewrayed" means revealed, betrayed, or exposed.
    *   Literary Devices: *Alliteration* of "hateful" and "hear." The use of the word "foe" builds suspense, and "bewrayed" adds a layer of dramatic effect.

*   **"But she, that yet her sad task hath not said,"**
    *   Meaning: But Lucrece, who has not yet finished the complete account of her suffering.
    *   Literary Devices: *Parenthetical phrase* - "that yet her sad task hath not said" interrupts the main sentence to emphasize her unfinished story.

*   **"The protestation stops. ‚ÄúO, speak,‚Äù quoth she,"**
    *   Meaning: The lords' eagerness to help is halted, and Lucrece interrupts their promises, saying, "O, speak." "Quoth she" is an archaic way of saying "she said."
    *   Literary Devices: *Caesura* (a pause) in the line due to punctuation emphasizes the interruption.

*   **‚ÄúHow may this forced stain be wiped from me?‚Äù**
    *   Meaning: She is asking how her honor, which has been defiled by this rape, can be restored or cleansed.
    *   Literary Devices: *Metaphor* - The rape is referred to as a "forced stain," indicating the defilement and dishonor it has caused. The question, rather than being literal, is rhetorical, highlighting her despair and concern for her reputation.

**Overall Meaning of the Stanza:**

This stanza depicts the initial reaction of the noblemen to Lucrece's revelation of her rape. They are moved by her plight and, motivated by their code of chivalry, are quick to offer their assistance and express their desire to bring her attacker to justice. However, Lucrece cuts them off, showing that their eagerness for revenge is not what she is most concerned with. Her primary focus is on the irreparable damage that has been done to her honor and reputation. She is less interested in punishment of the perpetrator than in her own purification. The stanza highlights the societal importance of honor and reputation, particularly for women in this period, and underscores the depth of Lucrece's anguish. It reveals that revenge, which the lords initially presume is her goal, is secondary to her own personal struggle with shame and dishonor.
