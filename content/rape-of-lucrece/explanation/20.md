# Stanza 20 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
Those that much covet are with gain so fond,
For what they have not, that which they possess
They scatter and unloose it from their bond,
And so, by hoping more, they have but less;
Or, gaining more, the profit of excess
Is but to surfeit, and such griefs sustain,
That they prove bankrupt in this poor-rich gain.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
This stanza from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* explores the destructive nature of avarice and insatiable desire. Let's break it down line by line:

* **Line 1: "Those that much covet are with gain so fond,"**  This line introduces the subject: those who excessively desire (covet) are foolishly attached ("fond") to the idea of gain.  "Covet" implies a restless, unsatisfied longing.

* **Line 2: "For what they have not, that which they possess / They scatter and unloose it from their bond,"** This is a crucial line.  It explains *why* the covetous are foolish. In their pursuit of what they *lack*, they neglect and squander ("scatter and unloose...from their bond") what they already *have*. The "bond" refers to the value or security of their possessions.  This is a clear example of **metaphor**, representing possessions as being bound, easily lost through reckless pursuit of more.

* **Line 3: "And so, by hoping more, they have but less;"** This line is the consequence of the previous one.  By constantly chasing more, they end up with less, both materially and perhaps spiritually. This is a **paradox**, highlighting the irony of their situation.

* **Line 4: "Or, gaining more, the profit of excess / Is but to surfeit, and such griefs sustain,"** This line offers an alternative scenario: even if they achieve their excessive goals, the "profit of excess" only brings about "surfeit" (overindulgence leading to discomfort) and "griefs."  This is another example of **paradox**, as more wealth leads to suffering.

* **Line 5: "That they prove bankrupt in this poor-rich gain."** This line provides the conclusion. Despite appearing rich, their excessive pursuit of wealth ultimately renders them "bankrupt."  This is a powerful **oxymoron** ("poor-rich gain") summarizing the whole stanza ‚Äì they are financially wealthy but spiritually and emotionally impoverished.

**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza argues that insatiable greed is self-defeating. The relentless pursuit of more leads to the neglect and loss of what one already possesses, resulting in unhappiness even if material gains are achieved.  The true wealth lies not in accumulating possessions but in appreciating and cherishing what one already has. Shakespeare uses the metaphor of binding and loosing to illustrate how greed weakens the value of one's existing assets. The stanza acts as a cautionary tale against avarice, foreshadowing the destructive consequences of uncontrolled desire, a theme relevant to Tarquin's lustful pursuit of Lucrece in the poem. The use of paradoxes and an oxymoron effectively emphasizes the irony and ultimately the tragic nature of unchecked ambition.
