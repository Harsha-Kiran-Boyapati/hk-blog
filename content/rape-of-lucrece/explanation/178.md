# Stanza 178 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
For men have marble, women waxen, minds,
And therefore are they form'd as marble will;
The weak oppress'd, the impression of strange kinds
Is form'd in them by force, by fraud, or skill:
Then call them not the authors of their ill,
No more than wax shall be accounted evil
Wherein is stamp'd the semblance of a devil.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down Stanza 178 of Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* line by line, identify the literary devices, and then synthesize it into an overall meaning.

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"For men have marble, women waxen, minds,"**
    *   *Meaning:* This line establishes a stark contrast between the presumed nature of men and women. Men are compared to *marble*, which is hard, durable, and resistant to change. Women are compared to *wax*, which is soft, pliable, and easily molded. The focus is on the minds, or inner natures.
    *   *Literary Devices:* **Metaphor** (marble and wax representing the minds), **Juxtaposition/Contrast** (between men and women), **Stereotype** (of gender roles)

*   **"And therefore are they form'd as marble will;"**
    *   *Meaning:* Because men are perceived to have strong, unchanging minds (like marble), they are given the power to mold and shape things as they see fit (as "marble will"). This speaks to the societal structures that allow men to be dominant and impose their will. "Form'd" can mean both literally "shaped" and figuratively "governed".
    *   *Literary Devices:* **Implied Power Dynamic**, **Allusion** (to the hardness and strength of marble)

*   **"The weak oppress'd, the impression of strange kinds"**
    *   *Meaning:* This line extends the previous one, describing the outcome of the power dynamic.  The "weak" (women implied) are "oppressed."  The "impression of strange kinds" refers to the experiences and influences forced upon them. It is specifically used to refer to the act of rape.
    *   *Literary Devices:* **Metaphor**, **Alliteration** ("kinds" and "impression")

*   **"Is form'd in them by force, by fraud, or skill:"**
    *   *Meaning:* This explains *how* the "impression" is made on women.  The line offers three methods: *force* (physical violence), *fraud* (deception), or *skill* (manipulation). This captures the multifaceted nature of male dominance and abuse. It also alludes to the ways that men can impose themselves on women, whether through overt actions or subtle and calculated approaches.
    *   *Literary Devices:* **Triad/Tricolon** (listing force, fraud, skill for emphasis), **Synonymy** (overlapping meanings reinforce the idea of male imposition)

*   **"Then call them not the authors of their ill,"**
    *   *Meaning:* This is the central argument. Given the previous lines, women should not be blamed for the "ill" (harm or wrongdoing) that befalls them. This is a direct plea for understanding and exoneration for Lucrece (and, by extension, all women in similar situations).
    *   *Literary Devices:* **Direct Address** (speaking to the audience/society), **Moral Argument/Exoneration**

*   **"No more than wax shall be accounted evil"**
    *   *Meaning:* This reinforces the argument using the wax metaphor. Wax is not inherently evil, even though it can be molded into something evil. This highlights the idea that women are not inherently responsible for the evil that is imprinted upon them.
    *   *Literary Devices:* **Analogy** (wax mirroring the situation of women), **Metaphor** (wax standing in for women)

*   **"Wherein is stamp'd the semblance of a devil."**
    *   *Meaning:* This is the final punch of the stanza. Even if wax is used to create an image of the devil, the wax itself is not to blame. Similarly, even if women are corrupted or "imprinted" with evil (through rape or other forms of oppression), they are not intrinsically evil. The "semblance of a devil" hints at the horrific impact of the act of rape on Lucrece's soul and reputation.
    *   *Literary Devices:* **Imagery** (vivid image of the devil imprinted on wax), **Metaphor** (devil representing the evil inflicted upon women), **Symbolism** (the "devil" is a symbol of the harm and disgrace caused by the rape).

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza is a powerful indictment of the societal structures that enable the oppression of women. Shakespeare argues that men, perceived as strong and unyielding, wield power and impose their will on women, whom they see as pliable and easily influenced. He uses the metaphors of marble and wax to illustrate this power dynamic.  Crucially, he argues that because women are shaped by external forces, they cannot be held responsible for the "ill" that befalls them.  He defends Lucrece against the potential accusations of complicity or fault, suggesting that she is a victim of circumstances and not the author of her own misfortune. The stanza serves as a strong moral argument for empathy and exoneration of women who have been harmed.  Shakespeare is not simply excusing Lucrece; he is challenging the audience to examine the systemic issues that contribute to such tragedies.
