# Stanza 56 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
Her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under,
Cozening the pillow of a lawful kiss;
Who, therefore angry, seems to part in sunder,
Swelling on either side to want his bliss;
Between whose hills her head entombed is:
Where, like a virtuous monument, she lies,
To be admired of lewd unhallow'd eyes.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"Her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under,"**
    *   *Analysis:* This line describes Lucrece's posture. "Lily hand" emphasizes the whiteness and delicacy of her hand. "Rosy cheek" emphasizes the vibrant color of her face. The hand is positioned beneath her cheek, indicating she is resting or asleep.
    *   *Literary Device:* **Metaphor** (comparing her hand to a lily). **Alliteration** ("lily lies"). **Inversion** - normal word order would be "Her lily hand lies under her rosy cheek." The altered word order adds emphasis.

*   **"Cozening the pillow of a lawful kiss;"**
    *   *Analysis:* "Cozening" means deceiving or cheating. The pillow is being tricked into receiving a kiss that is not "lawful," implying that the kiss would normally belong to her husband, Collatinus. Her hand is acting as a surrogate for that rightful kiss.
    *   *Literary Device:* **Personification** (giving the pillow human qualities - the ability to be "cozened"). **Euphemism** - hints at the sexual tension and the impending violation without explicitly mentioning it.

*   **"Who, therefore angry, seems to part in sunder,"**
    *   *Analysis:* "Who" refers back to the pillow (a continuation of the personification). Because it is being denied the lawful kiss, the pillow seems to be splitting apart ("part in sunder") in anger or frustration.
    *   *Literary Device:* **Personification** (continued). **Hyperbole** (exaggerating the pillow's reaction).

*   **"Swelling on either side to want his bliss;"**
    *   *Analysis:* The pillow's parting creates "swelling" sides. "Want his bliss" further emphasizes the pillow's desire for the kiss (or, perhaps, the embrace) it is being denied. "His" refers to the pillow.
    *   *Literary Device:* **Personification** (continued). **Synecdoche** - 'bliss' stands in for the greater pleasure of Lucrece.

*   **"Between whose hills her head entombed is:"**
    *   *Analysis:* "Hills" refers to the raised sides of the pillow created by the parting. Her head is nestled between these hills, as if it is buried or confined. "Entombed" is a strong word choice, foreshadowing Lucrece's fate and emphasizing her vulnerability.
    *   *Literary Device:* **Metaphor** (comparing the pillow's sides to hills). **Imagery** (evoking a sense of confinement and impending doom). **Foreshadowing** - Hints at the coming death.

*   **"Where, like a virtuous monument, she lies,"**
    *   *Analysis:* Lucrece is compared to a "virtuous monument," a statue erected to commemorate someone of great moral character. She is presented as an image of purity and worthiness, even in this vulnerable state.
    *   *Literary Device:* **Simile** (using "like" to compare Lucrece to a monument). **Irony** (because her virtue is precisely what makes her a target).

*   **"To be admired of lewd unhallow'd eyes."**
    *   *Analysis:* This line reveals the danger Lucrece is in. Her beauty and virtue, which should be celebrated, are instead attracting the "lewd unhallow'd eyes" of Tarquin. "Unhallowed" is a religious reference, emphasizing Tarquin's lack of respect for sacred things (including Lucrece's virtue).
    *   *Literary Device:* **Contrast** (between Lucrece's virtue and Tarquin's lust). **Allusion** (to religious concepts of sanctity).

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza paints a vivid picture of Lucrece sleeping peacefully, unaware of the danger she is in.  The imagery is richly suggestive, using personification and metaphor to create a sense of heightened tension.  The pillow, denied the "lawful kiss" that should rightfully belong to Lucrece's husband, becomes a symbol of the violation that is about to occur.  The comparison to a "virtuous monument" highlights Lucrece's purity, but also foreshadows her tragic fate, as her virtue makes her a target for Tarquin's lust. The closing line emphasizes the impending doom, as Lucrece's beauty is about to be profaned by "lewd unhallowed eyes." The stanza functions as a beautiful, yet ominous, setup for the unfolding tragedy, highlighting the contrast between innocence and corruption, virtue and lust.
