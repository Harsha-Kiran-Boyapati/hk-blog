# Stanza 78 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
Here with a cockatrice' dead-killing eye
He rouseth up himself and makes a pause;
While she, the picture of pure piety,
Like a white hind under the gripe's sharp claws,
Pleads, in a wilderness where are no laws,
To the rough beast that knows no gentle right,
Nor aught obeys but his foul appetite.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"Here with a cockatrice' dead-killing eye"**
    *   *Meaning:*  This describes Tarquin's gaze. The *cockatrice* is a mythical creature, a serpent or dragon whose glance could kill. Therefore, Tarquin's stare is depicted as lethal, full of malicious intent, and foreboding. It also suggests that he is as devoid of any kind of mercy as a cockatrice.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Allusion:** To the mythological creature, the cockatrice.
        *   **Metaphor:** Tarquin's eye is *like* a cockatrice's eye in its destructive power.

*   **"He rouseth up himself and makes a pause;"**
    *   *Meaning:* Tarquin gathers himself, perhaps summoning his determination or steeling his resolve to commit the act he is about to perpetrate. The pause emphasizes the moment of decision, the point where he could still turn back but chooses not to.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Enjambment:** The sentence continues from the first line, creating a sense of suspense.
        *   **Implied Action:** This line depicts Tarquin rousing and shows his planning and preparation.

*   **"While she, the picture of pure piety,"**
    *   *Meaning:* This is a stark contrast to Tarquin. Lucrece is presented as the embodiment of virtue and religious devotion. She is innocent and blameless.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Metaphor:** Lucrece is *like* a picture of piety; she perfectly embodies the concept.
        *   **Imagery:**  The word "picture" evokes a visual representation of purity.

*   **"Like a white hind under the gripe's sharp claws,"**
    *   *Meaning:* This describes Lucrece's vulnerability. A "hind" is a female deer, often associated with innocence and gentleness. A "gripe" is a griffin (a mythical creature with an eagle's head and wings and a lion's body), signifying Tarquin as a predator. The claws emphasize his predatory nature and her defencelessness.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Simile:** Lucrece is *like* a hind under the claws of a griffin.
        *   **Symbolism:** The white hind symbolizes purity and innocence, while the griffin symbolizes predatory aggression and power.
        *   **Imagery:**  The image of the hind trapped in the griffin's claws is vivid and disturbing.

*   **"Pleads, in a wilderness where are no laws,"**
    *   *Meaning:* Lucrece tries to reason with Tarquin, but her pleas are futile. She is in a "wilderness," a place devoid of justice, morality, or any restraining influence. This emphasizes Tarquin's lawless behaviour.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Metaphor:** The "wilderness" represents the moral vacuum where Tarquin operates.
        *   **Symbolism:** Wilderness: a place of danger, isolation, lack of civilization, and lack of rules.

*   **"To the rough beast that knows no gentle right,"**
    *   *Meaning:* Tarquin is described as a "rough beast," highlighting his animalistic nature, lack of civility, and disregard for moral principles or any concept of justice. He is governed by base instincts rather than reason or compassion.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Metaphor:** Tarquin is *like* a "rough beast."
        *   **Imagery:** "Rough" evokes a sense of coarseness, lack of refinement, and potential for violence.

*   **"Nor aught obeys but his foul appetite."**
    *   *Meaning:* Tarquin is solely driven by his lust and desire. He is uncontrollable and ignores all other considerations.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Alliteration:** Emphasises the destructive nature of Tarquin's desire.
        *   **Imagery:** "Foul" evokes a sense of disgust and moral corruption.

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza paints a harrowing picture of the imbalance of power and the tragedy about to unfold. Lucrece, the embodiment of innocence and piety, is utterly vulnerable and helpless against Tarquin, a man consumed by lust and devoid of morality. The stark contrasts between them highlight the horror of the impending rape. The stanza establishes a setting where justice and reason are absent, leaving Lucrece completely at the mercy of Tarquin's brutal desires. Shakespeare emphasizes the animalistic and predatory nature of Tarquin, stripping him of any pretense of humanity and portraying him as a force of pure, destructive appetite. The allusions and imagery create a sense of dread and foreshadow the tragic consequences that will follow. It is a powerful condemnation of unchecked power and the devastating impact of violence on the innocent.
