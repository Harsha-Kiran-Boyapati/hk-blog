# Stanza 45 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
As each unwilling portal yields him way,
Through little vents and crannies of the place
The wind wars with his torch to make him stay,
And blows the smoke of it into his face,
Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
But his hot heart, which fond desire doth scorch,
Puffs forth another wind that fires the torch:
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

**As each unwilling portal yields him way,**  
Tarquin, the intruder, is forcing his way through doors ("unwilling portals") that do not open for him willingly, symbolizing the resistance of both the physical space and Lucrece herself.

**Through little vents and crannies of the place**  
He moves stealthily, taking advantage of small openings and cracks in the building, emphasizing his secretive and illicit intentions.

**The wind wars with his torch to make him stay,**  
As he moves, the wind blows against his torch, as if nature itself is trying to hinder his progress and prevent him from going further.

**And blows the smoke of it into his face,**  
The wind not only threatens to extinguish the torch but also blows the smoke into Tarquin‚Äôs face, blinding and impeding him, symbolizing both literal and moral obstruction.

**Extinguishing his conduct in this case;**  
The wind almost puts out his torch, which is his guide ("conduct") in the darkness, suggesting that his path is not only physically but morally obscured.

**But his hot heart, which fond desire doth scorch,**  
Despite these obstacles, Tarquin‚Äôs burning passion ("hot heart") and uncontrollable desire drive him on, undeterred by the resistance of the world around him.

**Puffs forth another wind that fires the torch:**  
His own breath, heated by his desire, rekindles the torch, symbolizing how his lust overcomes all opposition, both natural and moral.
