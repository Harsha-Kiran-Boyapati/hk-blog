# Stanza 223 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
‚ÄúSuch devils steal effects from lightless hell,
For Sinon in his fire doth quake with cold,
And in that cold hot-burning fire doth dwell.
These contraries such unity do hold,
Only to flatter fools and make them bold;
So Priam‚Äôs trust false Sinon‚Äôs tears doth flatter,
That he finds means to burn his Troy with water.‚Äù
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down stanza 223 of Shakespeare's "The Rape of Lucrece" line by line and then discuss its overall meaning and literary devices.

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"Such devils steal effects from lightless hell,"**
    *   **Analysis:** This line establishes the demonic nature of deceit. "Lightless hell" emphasizes the utter darkness and absence of goodness from which these evil influences originate. "Effects" is vague but most probably refers to things or people which have been affected by the devilish deception.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Metaphor:** The devils are symbols of falsehood and evil, metaphorically stealing influence from hell.
        *   **Imagery:** "Lightless hell" provides a stark and vivid image of darkness and despair.

*   **"For Sinon in his fire doth quake with cold,"**
    *   **Analysis:** This introduces Sinon, the Greek who tricked the Trojans into accepting the Trojan Horse.  The phrase "in his fire doth quake with cold" describes an unnatural and paradoxical state. Sinon is consumed by the "fire" of his deceit and malicious intent, yet he simultaneously "quakes with cold," possibly indicating his own internal guilt, fear, or the chilling nature of his deception.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Allusion:** Sinon is a well-known figure from classical literature (the *Aeneid*).
        *   **Paradox:** The oxymoronic phrase "fire doth quake with cold" highlights the self-contradictory nature of Sinon's actions and perhaps his own internal state.

*   **"And in that cold hot-burning fire doth dwell."**
    *   **Analysis:** This line is a reiteration and expansion of the previous line, further emphasizing the paradoxical nature of Sinon's situation. It suggests that the "cold" fear or calculation and the "hot-burning fire" of his malice are intertwined and inseparable.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Paradox:** Continues the paradox of opposing elements existing together.
        *   **Repetition (of the concept):** The rephrasing of the previous line amplifies the paradoxical image.

*   **"These contraries such unity do hold,"**
    *   **Analysis:** This line generalizes the specific case of Sinon, stating that such contradictions and oppositions (like cold and fire, honesty and deception) can, strangely, exist in a state of unity.  This unity is the deceptive appearance that hides the true evil.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Abstract Language:** "Contraries" and "unity" are abstract concepts.

*   **"Only to flatter fools and make them bold;"**
    *   **Analysis:** This explains *why* these contradictions can exist in unity: to deceive and embolden the foolish. The purpose of the illusion, the unified appearance of opposites, is to manipulate those who are naive and make them confident in their false beliefs.  "Bold" here likely means reckless or overconfident.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Irony:** It's ironic that the goal is to make fools "bold," as boldness should be based on truth, not deception.

*   **"So Priam‚Äôs trust false Sinon‚Äôs tears doth flatter,"**
    *   **Analysis:** This line brings the argument back to the specific example of Sinon and Priam.  Priam, the king of Troy, "trusts" Sinon (believes his lies).  Sinon's deceptive "tears" ("flatter" in this context means to deceive or beguile) lull Priam into a false sense of security.  The tears are a performance.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Allusion:** Continues the allusion to the Trojan War.

*   **"That he finds means to burn his Troy with water."**
    *   **Analysis:** This is the final consequence of the deception.  Because Priam trusts Sinon's false tears, Sinon finds a way to destroy Troy.  The phrase "burn his Troy with water" is another paradox. Water is typically used to extinguish fire, not cause it. It represents the deceptive means (the tears, the false story) by which Sinon achieves his destructive goal. It alludes to the Trojan Horse.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Paradox:** "Burn his Troy with water" is a final, powerful paradox encapsulating the deceptive nature of the events.
        *   **Imagery:** The burning of Troy is a powerful image of destruction.
        *   **Metonymy/Synecdoche:** "Water" stands in for Sinon's deceitful actions.

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza explores the deceptive power of appearances. It argues that evil forces can create a false unity between contradictory elements in order to manipulate and deceive those who are foolish and trusting.  The example of Sinon and Priam serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of taking things at face value and highlights the devastating consequences of being blinded by deception.  The paradoxes within the stanza underscore the unnatural and perverse nature of deceit, demonstrating how falsehood can twist and pervert the natural order.

**Key Literary Devices Summarized:**

*   **Metaphor:** To convey abstract ideas and create imagery.
*   **Allusion:** To the classical story of Sinon and Priam, providing context and weight.
*   **Paradox:** To highlight the self-contradictory nature of deception and evil.
*   **Imagery:** To create vivid mental pictures that reinforce the themes.
*   **Irony:** Highlighting the contrast between what is expected and what actually happens.
*   **Repetition (of concepts):**  Amplifies the core idea.
*   **Metonymy/Synecdoche:** "Water" standing in for deceitful actions.

Shakespeare uses these literary devices to create a powerful and insightful exploration of the destructive nature of deception and its ability to exploit human weaknesses.
