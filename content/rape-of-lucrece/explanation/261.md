# Stanza 261 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
‚ÄúWhy, Collatine, is woe the cure for woe?
Do wounds help wounds, or grief help grievous deeds?
Is it revenge to give thyself a blow
For his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds?
Such childish humour from weak minds proceeds.
Thy wretched wife mistook the matter so,
To slay herself, that should have slain her foe.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Let's break down Stanza 261 from Shakespeare's "The Rape of Lucrece":

**1. "Why, Collatine, is woe the cure for woe?"**

*   **"Why, Collatine,"**: This is an address to Collatine, Lucrece's husband. The "Why" begins a rhetorical question, drawing attention to the following statements.
*   **"is woe the cure for woe?"**: This is a rhetorical question. The speaker (likely someone close to Collatine or Lucrece) is asking whether sadness or grief can heal sadness or grief. It implies that Collatine's despair is not the answer.

**2. "Do wounds help wounds, or grief help grievous deeds?"**

*   **"Do wounds help wounds..."**: Another rhetorical question, using a simple, visceral analogy. Physical wounds cannot heal other physical wounds.
*   **"...or grief help grievous deeds?"**: A continuation of the analogy. Grief, in this context, cannot undo or alleviate the heinous deed (the rape). "Grievous deeds" refers to the act of the rape and the resulting shame and suffering.

**3. "Is it revenge to give thyself a blow"**

*   **"Is it revenge..."**: Another rhetorical question that questions the nature of Collatine's actions or planned actions.
*   **"...to give thyself a blow"**: This could refer to self-harm, or the grief that Collatine feels. It is not a productive answer in this scenario.

**4. "For his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds?"**

*   **"For his foul act"**: This refers to the act of Tarquin, the rapist. The word "foul" highlights the depravity of the act.
*   **"by whom thy fair wife bleeds?"**: This continues the thought, emphasizing that this act is the cause of his wife's suffering, both physically and emotionally.

**5. "Such childish humour from weak minds proceeds."**

*   **"Such childish humour"**: Refers to the emotional response (likely the rage, despair, and possible suicidal thoughts) that the speaker disapproves of.
*   **"from weak minds proceeds"**: This is a judgement, implying that these immature emotional responses are the result of a lack of strength or fortitude.

**6. "Thy wretched wife mistook the matter so,"**

*   **"Thy wretched wife"**: This acknowledges Lucrece's suffering.
*   **"mistook the matter so"**: This is a direct condemnation of Lucrece's suicide, suggesting that she did not understand the correct course of action.

**7. "To slay herself, that should have slain her foe."**

*   **"To slay herself"**: This refers to Lucrece's suicide.
*   **"that should have slain her foe."**: This strongly implies that Tarquin, the perpetrator, should have been the one to suffer the consequences, not Lucrece.

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza is a critical assessment of both Collatine's and, especially, Lucrece's reactions to the rape. It argues that grief and self-inflicted suffering (Collatine's anguish or potential for self harm, Lucrece's suicide) are not appropriate responses to the crime. Instead, the speaker implies that the proper response is one of strength, action, and retribution directed at the perpetrator, Tarquin. The speaker views Lucrece's suicide as a tragic misunderstanding, an incorrect reaction to the crime.

**Literary Devices:**

*   **Rhetorical Questions**: Used throughout to provoke thought and challenge the characters' perspectives. The questions guide the reader/listener toward a particular conclusion.
*   **Analogy**: "Do wounds help wounds, or grief help grievous deeds?" compares emotional pain to physical harm to highlight the futility of self-inflicted suffering as a solution.
*   **Metaphor**: Woe is being compared to wounds.
*   **Juxtaposition**: Contrasting Collatine and Lucrece with the act of rape shows the effect of the action.
*   **Diction**: Shakespeare chooses emotionally charged words such as "foul," "wretched," "childish," and "weak" to shape the reader's understanding of the situation and the speaker's viewpoint.
*   **Irony**: The speaker highlights an ironic situation: the victim (Lucrece) is dead, while the perpetrator lives.
*   **Understatement**: The act of suicide is downplayed compared to the crime of rape.
