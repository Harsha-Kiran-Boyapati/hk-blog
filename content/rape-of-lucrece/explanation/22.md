# Stanza 22 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
So that in venturing ill we leave to be
The things we are for that which we expect;
And this ambitious foul infirmity,
In having much, torments us with defect
Of that we have: so then we do neglect
The thing we have; and, all for want of wit,
Make something nothing by augmenting it.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Let's break down Shakespeare's stanza 22 from *The Rape of Lucrece* line by line, identifying literary devices along the way:


* **"So that in venturing ill we leave to be / The things we are for that which we expect;"**

    * **"So that in venturing ill"**: This sets the context.  "Venturing ill" refers to taking risky actions, pursuing ill-advised goals, often driven by ambition.
    * **"we leave to be / The things we are"**:  This is a powerful statement highlighting the self-destructive nature of such ventures. We abandon our present selves, our current state of being, often neglecting our existing possessions or happiness.
    * **"for that which we expect"**: This points towards the allure of future possibilities and the hope of gaining something greater. This phrase highlights the seductive nature of ambition.  This is an example of **antithesis**, contrasting "what we are" with "what we expect."


* **"And this ambitious foul infirmity,"**

    * This line summarizes the preceding lines.  "Ambitious foul infirmity" personifies ambition as a disease or weakness ("infirmity").  The word "foul" adds a moral judgment, implying that ambition in this context is corrupting.


* **"In having much, torments us with defect / Of that we have:"**

    * **"In having much, torments us with defect"**: This is a paradoxical statement.  Despite possessing much, abundance ironically leads to a sense of lack or deficiency. This highlights the insatiable nature of ambition.
    * **"Of that we have"**:  We are tormented by a perceived deficiency in what we *already* possess, often because our desires are perpetually exceeding our attainment.  This is another example of **paradox**.


* **"So then we do neglect / The thing we have; and, all for want of wit,"**

    * **"So then we do neglect / The thing we have"**: This is a direct consequence of the previous lines. Driven by our insatiable desire, we neglect and undervalue what we already have.
    * **"and, all for want of wit"**: This assigns blame to a lack of wisdom or good judgment.  This is a simple, direct statement emphasizing folly.


* **"Make something nothing by augmenting it."**

    * This final line is a powerful **oxymoron**.  By trying to make something *more* (augmenting it), we end up making it *less* (nothing).  It perfectly sums up the self-defeating nature of unchecked ambition.  It is a concise and impactful conclusion to the stanza.


**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza explores the destructive nature of unchecked ambition.  Shakespeare argues that the pursuit of more often leads to a dissatisfaction with what one already possesses.  This relentless pursuit, driven by a lack of wisdom ("want of wit"), ironically diminishes the value of existing things.  The more we try to gain, the more we lose the appreciation of what we already have, ultimately rendering our gains meaningless.  The stanza warns against the perils of insatiable desire and the importance of appreciating the present.  The literary devices employed, particularly paradox and oxymoron, emphasize the ironic and self-destructive nature of this insatiable ambition.
