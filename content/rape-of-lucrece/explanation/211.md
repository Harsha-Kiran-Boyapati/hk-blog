# Stanza 211 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
‚ÄúShow me the strumpet that began this stir,
That with my nails her beauty I may tear.
Thy heat of lust, fond Paris, did incur
This load of wrath that burning Troy doth bear;
Thy eye kindled the fire that burneth here,
And here in Troy, for trespass of thine eye,
The sire, the son, the dame, and daughter die.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down stanza 211 of Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* line by line and then discuss its overall meaning, paying attention to literary devices.

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **‚ÄúShow me the strumpet that began this stir,‚Äù**
    *   **Meaning:**  The speaker (Lucrece, in her mind, imagining the aftermath of a similar catastrophe) is demanding to be shown the "strumpet" (a derogatory term for a promiscuous woman) who is responsible for starting the conflict. The "stir" refers to a major upheaval or conflict, in this case, the Trojan War.
    *   **Literary Device:**  **Metaphor/Synecdoche:** "Strumpet" functions as a metaphor for the underlying lust and betrayal that initiated the war. It can also be considered synecdoche - using a part to represent the whole, with the adulterous act representing all the violence and destruction.

*   **‚ÄúThat with my nails her beauty I may tear.‚Äù**
    *   **Meaning:** The speaker expresses a violent desire to physically assault the "strumpet," specifically to tear at her beauty with her nails. This highlights the rage and vengeful feelings associated with betrayal and the devastation it causes.
    *   **Literary Device:**  **Imagery:**  The line provides a graphic and visceral image of violence, emphasizing the speaker's passionate anger. **Alliteration:** The repeated 't' sound in "tear" creates a sharper, more forceful sound.

*   **‚ÄúThy heat of lust, fond Paris, did incur**
    *   **Meaning:** This line directly addresses Paris, the Trojan prince whose abduction of Helen, the wife of Menelaus, sparked the Trojan War.  The phrase "heat of lust" blames Paris's uncontrolled desire for Helen. "Fond" means foolish or infatuated. "Incur" means to bring upon oneself.
    *   **Literary Device:** **Direct Address (Apostrophe):** The stanza directly addresses Paris, even though he is not present. **Allusion:**  Refers to the mythological story of Paris and Helen.

*   **‚ÄúThis load of wrath that burning Troy doth bear;‚Äù**
    *   **Meaning:**  Paris's lust has brought about the immense "load of wrath" that the city of Troy is now suffering. The city is actively burning as it bears the burden of the consequences of Paris's actions.
    *   **Literary Device:** **Metaphor:** The "load of wrath" represents the suffering, destruction, and ultimately, the fall of Troy. **Personification:** "Burning Troy doth bear" gives the city human characteristics by saying it is "bearing" the load.

*   **‚ÄúThy eye kindled the fire that burneth here,‚Äù**
    *   **Meaning:**  This line continues to blame Paris, stating that his lustful "eye" (his desire for Helen) started the destructive "fire" that is consuming Troy.
    *   **Literary Device:** **Metaphor:** The "fire" represents the war and its associated destruction. **Synecdoche:** "Eye" represents Paris's entire lustful desire.

*   **‚ÄúAnd here in Troy, for trespass of thine eye,‚Äù**
    *   **Meaning:** Reinforces that in the city of Troy, the devastation is occurring solely because of the transgression, the sin, of Paris's "eye" (his lust).
    *   **Literary Device:**  **Repetition:** Reinforces the culpability of Paris. **Synecdoche:** "Eye" again represents Paris's lustful desire.

*   **‚ÄúThe sire, the son, the dame, and daughter die.‚Äù**
    *   **Meaning:** This line lists the victims of the war, emphasizing the indiscriminate nature of the destruction. "Sire" is father, "son" is male child, "dame" is mother, and "daughter" is female child.
    *   **Literary Device:** **Polysyndeton:** The use of multiple conjunctions ("and") creates a sense of overwhelming loss and the sheer number of casualties. **Synecdoche:** "Sire, Son, Dame, Daughter" is using a group of representative family members to signify the entire population of Troy.

**Overall Meaning of the Stanza:**

The stanza is a powerful condemnation of lust and its devastating consequences.  Through the imagined voice of a woman wronged, Shakespeare uses the example of the Trojan War to illustrate how unchecked desire can lead to immense suffering, not just for individuals but for entire societies. The stanza places the blame squarely on Paris, whose "heat of lust" is portrayed as the spark that ignited a conflagration of violence and destruction.  Importantly, the stanza doesn't just focus on the romantic relationship; it emphasizes the *social* and *political* ramifications of uncontrolled desire.  The use of vivid imagery, direct address, and rhetorical devices underscores the passionate and accusatory tone, emphasizing the destructive power of unchecked desire and the innocence of those who become its victims. This connects directly to Lucrece's own situation, as she's contemplating the devastation that Tarquin's lust has brought upon her and her family's honor.
