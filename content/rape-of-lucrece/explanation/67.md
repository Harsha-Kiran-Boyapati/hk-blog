# Stanza 67 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
His hand, that yet remains upon her breast,--
Rude ram, to batter such an ivory wall!--
May feel her heart-poor citizen!--distress'd,
Wounding itself to death, rise up and fall,
Beating her bulk, that his hand shakes withal.
This moves in him more rage and lesser pity,
To make the breach and enter this sweet city.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"His hand, that yet remains upon her breast,‚Äì"**

    *   *His hand:* Refers to Tarquin's hand.
    *   *that yet remains upon her breast:* Emphasizes the ongoing, violating act. The word "yet" suggests a lingering, prolonged assault.
    *   The dash (‚Äì) indicates a pause or a break in thought, creating suspense and drawing attention to the brutality of the action.

*   **"Rude ram, to batter such an ivory wall!‚Äì"**

    *   *Rude ram:* A *metaphor*. Tarquin's hand is compared to a "ram" (a battering ram), an instrument of destruction used to break down walls. "Rude" implies its coarse and violent nature.
    *   *to batter such an ivory wall!:* A *metaphor*. Lucrece's breast is compared to a delicate "ivory wall." Ivory suggests purity, beauty, and preciousness, contrasting sharply with the "rude ram." The exclamation point (!) amplifies the horror and injustice of the situation.

*   **"May feel her heart‚Äìpoor citizen!‚Äìdistress'd,"**

    *   *May feel her heart:* Suggests that Tarquin, through his touch, could potentially perceive Lucrece's emotional and physical pain.
    *   *poor citizen!:* A *metaphor*. Lucrece's heart is personified as a "citizen" within the "city" of her body. This citizen is "poor," implying its vulnerability and lack of power, and "distress'd," indicating its suffering. The dashes emphasize the heart's isolation and agony. This is also a form of *apostrophe,* as he is addressing the heart.

*   **"Wounding itself to death, rise up and fall,"**

    *   *Wounding itself to death:* Continues the personification of the heart, suggesting that her emotional anguish is so severe that it's self-destructive.
    *   *rise up and fall:* Describes the rapid, irregular heartbeat caused by fear and trauma. This imagery evokes the physical manifestation of extreme emotional distress.

*   **"Beating her bulk, that his hand shakes withal."**

    *   *Beating her bulk:* "Bulk" here refers to Lucrece's body. Her heart is beating so violently that it's shaking her entire body.
    *   *that his hand shakes withal:* The hand of Tarquin, the abuser, is also shaking. This could be from lust, adrenaline, or a hint of internal conflict, though the following lines suggest the former. "Withal" is an archaic way of saying "with it."

*   **"This moves in him more rage and lesser pity,"**

    *   *This:* Refers to the described physical and emotional distress of Lucrece.
    *   *moves in him more rage and lesser pity:* Paradoxically, instead of being moved to compassion, Tarquin is further inflamed. Her suffering fuels his lustful anger, diminishing any potential for empathy or remorse.

*   **"To make the breach and enter this sweet city."**

    *   *To make the breach:* A *metaphor*. Refers to Tarquin's resolve to break down Lucrece's resistance and violate her.
    *   *and enter this sweet city:* A *metaphor*. Lucrece's body is again described as a "sweet city" that Tarquin is determined to conquer. "Sweet" contrasts with the brutality of the act, highlighting the innocence he is destroying. The finality and definiteness of the line brings the reader to the climax of the impending rape.

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza depicts the moment just before Tarquin commits the rape. He is aware of Lucrece's distress and vulnerability. Her fear and her heart's frantic struggle are palpable. However, instead of deterring him, her suffering only increases his desire and determination to overpower her. The stanza uses vivid imagery and metaphors to emphasize the violent nature of his intentions and the tragic destruction of Lucrece's purity and innocence. The stanza is a powerful study of lust, cruelty, and the complete absence of empathy. The imagery of the city under siege underlines the idea of Lucrece's body being invaded and violated against her will.

**Literary Devices:**

*   **Metaphor:** (Hand as "rude ram," Lucrece's breast/body as "ivory wall" and "sweet city," Heart as "poor citizen") This is the most prominent device. The metaphors create vivid imagery and highlight the violent invasion and the vulnerability of the victim.
*   **Personification:** (Heart "distress'd," "wounding itself to death") Giving human qualities to the heart emphasizes Lucrece's emotional turmoil.
*   **Alliteration:** Repetition of sounds "Beating her bulk" adds to the poetic effect.
*   **Apostrophe:** Addressing the heart (poor citizen!)
*   **Exclamation:** Used to emphasize the severity of the act.
*   **Dashes:** Create pauses and emphasize certain phrases.
*   **Paradox:** Her suffering causes rage, not pity, in Tarquin.
*   **Contrast:** Juxtaposition of "rude ram" and "ivory wall" emphasizes the violence against purity. The "sweet city" is about to be defiled.
