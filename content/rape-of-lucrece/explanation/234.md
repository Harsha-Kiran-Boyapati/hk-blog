**Overall Meaning:**

In this stanza, Tarquin lays out his horrifying ultimatum to Lucrece. He threatens to murder one of her servants and then Lucrece herself.  He then explains his plan to claim he caught her in the act of adultery with the murdered servant and that he killed them both in righteous anger.  He claims this false narrative will become his source of glory, while simultaneously, ensuring Lucrece's name will be forever tarnished in shame. The stanza showcases Tarquin's manipulative and cruel nature, as well as the social constraints and consequences faced by women accused of sexual transgression. It highlights the power imbalance between Tarquin and Lucrece and the horrific choice she is being forced to make.
