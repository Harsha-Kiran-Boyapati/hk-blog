# Stanza 124 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
'So then he hath it when he cannot use it,
And leaves it to be master'd by his young;
Who in their pride do presently abuse it:
Their father was too weak, and they too strong,
To hold their cursed-blessed fortune long.
The sweets we wish for turn to loathed sours
Even in the moment that we call them ours.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Let's break down Shakespeare's Stanza 124 from *The Rape of Lucrece*:

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"So then he hath it when he cannot use it,"**
    *   **Meaning:** "He" (Tarquin, implied from the context of the poem) possesses power or fortune, but is unable to properly enjoy or utilize it. The "it" could be interpreted as his kingship, his social standing, or even the ill-gotten satisfaction he seeks through the rape of Lucrece. He's consumed by guilt and shame, rendering the possession hollow.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Pronoun ambiguity* (he is not clearly defined as Tarquin directly).

*   **"And leaves it to be master'd by his young;"**
    *   **Meaning:** Tarquin's power and the consequences of his actions will be inherited by his children. He will leave his legacy and fortune (and also a society ripe for revolt due to his actions) to his sons. "Master'd" implies both inheritance and potential control/domination.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Implied Foreshadowing*: Hints at the future consequences of Tarquin's actions on his family.

*   **"Who in their pride do presently abuse it:"**
    *   **Meaning:** Tarquin's children, fueled by arrogance ("pride"), will quickly misuse or corrupt the power they inherit. They will not learn from their father's mistakes and will continue the cycle of abuse.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Characterization*: Highlights the negative qualities (pride, abuse) of the next generation. *Alliteration*: the repeated 'p' sound in 'pride do presently'

*   **"Their father was too weak, and they too strong,"**
    *   **Meaning:** Tarquin was too weak (morally, spiritually) to control his desires and impulses. His sons, by contrast, will be too "strong" (in the sense of being tyrannical and ruthless) in their use of power. This highlights a generational failing of moderation and self-control.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Antithesis*: "weak" versus "strong" creates a direct contrast between father and sons.

*   **"To hold their cursed-blessed fortune long."**
    *   **Meaning:** Neither the father (Tarquin) nor his sons will be able to maintain their "fortune" (kingdom, power) for an extended period of time because of their actions. The "cursed-blessed" paradox shows the duality of their position. Their fortune is a source of power and privilege (blessed) but is tainted by immorality and destined to bring downfall (cursed).
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Oxymoron*: "cursed-blessed" is a contradiction that creates a complex meaning. *Foreshadowing*: Again, the stanza hints at the ultimate overthrow of Tarquin's dynasty, foreshadowing the Roman Republic.

*   **"The sweets we wish for turn to loathed sours"**
    *   **Meaning:** The pleasures we desire ("sweets") eventually become distasteful and hateful ("loathed sours"). This is a universal observation about the ephemeral and often disappointing nature of worldly desires. Implies that ill gotten gains or immoral actions, which may at first seem pleasurable, will ultimately turn bitter.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Metaphor*: Compares desires to flavors, highlighting the changing nature of satisfaction.

*   **"Even in the moment that we call them ours."**
    *   **Meaning:** This line emphasizes the fleeting and deceptive nature of pleasure. The moment we think we have fully possessed and enjoyed something, it can turn sour.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Emphasis*: Underscores the transience of happiness. *Paradox*: The paradox is that the moment we claim something "ours," its value can diminish or its negative consequences can begin to manifest.

**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza is a reflection on the nature of power, desire, and inheritance. It argues that ill-gotten gains and unchecked ambition are ultimately self-destructive. Tarquin's lust and abuse of power will have far-reaching consequences, affecting his sons, his dynasty, and, ultimately, the fate of Rome. The stanza serves as a warning about the dangers of unchecked power and the ultimate futility of pursuing pleasure at the expense of morality. It also explores the idea that happiness is fleeting and that the things we desire most can ultimately bring us the greatest disappointment. The cursed and blessed aspect of fortune also reinforces the idea that power can be a source of both great good and great evil, and that it is the responsibility of those who wield it to use it wisely.

**Key Literary Devices Summary:**

*   **Pronoun ambiguity:** Unclear pronoun reference forces reader engagement.
*   **Foreshadowing:** Hints at future events and consequences.
*   **Characterization:** Reveals the flaws and potential downfall of characters.
*   **Antithesis:** Contrasting ideas highlight opposing forces.
*   **Oxymoron:** Juxtaposes contradictory terms to create complex meaning.
*   **Metaphor:** Uses figurative language to represent abstract concepts.
*   **Emphasis:** Underlines important themes and ideas.
*   **Paradox:** Presents seemingly contradictory statements that reveal a deeper truth.
*   **Alliteration** Repeated 'p' sound to empahsize words.

This stanza encapsulates a central theme of *The Rape of Lucrece*: the destructive consequences of lust, the corruption of power, and the cyclical nature of violence and abuse. It highlights the importance of moral responsibility and the fleeting nature of worldly pleasures.
