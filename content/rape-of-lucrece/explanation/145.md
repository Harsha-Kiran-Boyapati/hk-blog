# Stanza 145 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
'The crow may bathe his coal-black wings in mire,
And unperceived fly with the filth away;
But if the like the snow-white swan desire,
The stain upon his silver down will stay.
Poor grooms are sightless night, kings glorious day:
Gnats are unnoted wheresoe'er they fly,
But eagles gazed upon with every eye.
```

        *   **Contrast:** Again, reinforces the difference between the treatment of those of high and low status.

**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza conveys the idea that social status significantly affects how actions are perceived and judged. People of low status can commit shameful acts without much notice, but people of high status are held to a much higher standard.  Their actions, good or bad, are magnified, and any transgression leaves a lasting stain on their reputation.  The stanza highlights the unfairness of the situation. It emphasizes that those in power are subject to greater scrutiny, and thus, greater consequences for their misdeeds.  This applies directly to Lucrece's situation; because of her high social standing and virtuous reputation, her rape and subsequent suicide have a much greater impact than if she were a commoner.  It foreshadows the political upheaval that will result from Tarquin's crime.

**Key Literary Devices Recap:**

*   **Symbolism:** Crow, Swan, Mire, Night, Day, Gnats, Eagles all symbolize social status, moral character, and visibility.
*   **Metaphor:** Using images of birds, insects, and natural phenomena to represent human characters and their actions.
*   **Contrast:** The stanza relies heavily on contrasting imagery (crow/swan, night/day, gnats/eagles) to emphasize the different treatment of people based on their social status.
*   **Alliteration:** "Coal-black," "snow-white," "stain/stay" creates emphasis and musicality.
*   **Hyperbole:** "Every eye" exaggerates the scrutiny given to those of high status.
*   **Imagery:** Vivid descriptions that appeal to the senses (especially sight) to create a lasting impression.

This stanza is a powerful commentary on social dynamics, reputation, and the burdens and responsibilities that come with high status. It is also a direct reflection on Lucrece‚Äôs plight as a high-born woman who is forever shamed by Tarquin's actions.
