# Stanza 147 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
'In vain I rail at Opportunity,
At Time, at Tarquin, and uncheerful Night;
In vain I cavil with mine infamy,
In vain I spurn at my confirm'd despite:
This helpless smoke of words doth me no right.
The remedy indeed to do me good
Is to let forth my foul-defiled blood.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down Stanza 147 from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* and then discuss its overall meaning and literary devices.

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"In vain I rail at Opportunity"**:
    *   *In vain:* This phrase is repeated throughout the stanza, emphasizing the futility of Lucrece's efforts. It sets a tone of despair and powerlessness.
    *   *Rail at Opportunity:*  To "rail" means to protest bitterly or vehemently. Lucrece is angrily blaming Opportunity for presenting the situation that allowed Tarquin to rape her. Opportunity represents the circumstances that allowed the crime to occur.

*   **"At Time, at Tarquin, and uncheerful Night;"**:
    *   This line continues the list of things Lucrece is railing against.
    *   *Time:* Lucrece blames time itself, perhaps for allowing the events to unfold or for not preventing them.
    *   *Tarquin:*  The clear and direct blaming of Tarquin is a crucial point. He is the agent of the crime.
    *   *Uncheerful Night:* Night, being dark and secretive, is seen as complicit in the crime. It provided the cover for Tarquin's actions. Personification of night as 'uncheerful'.

*   **"In vain I cavil with mine infamy,"**:
    *   *Cavil:*  To raise petty or trivial objections. Here, it means Lucrece is arguing or quibbling with the shame or dishonor she feels she has incurred.
    *   *Infamy:* The shame and disgrace that has now befallen her because of the rape. She is trying to reason her way out of the shame, but it is no use.

*   **"In vain I spurn at my confirm'd despite:"**:
    *   *Spurn:* To reject or kick away, figuratively pushing back against something.
    *   *Confirm'd despite:*  "Despite" means malice, contempt, or defiance. "Confirm'd" suggests that this spite/contempt/hatred (likely directed at herself or the situation) is now a fixed and unchangeable part of her reality.

*   **"This helpless smoke of words doth me no right."**:
    *   *Helpless smoke of words:* This is a powerful metaphor. Lucrece's words, her complaints, her railing, are insubstantial and ineffective, like smoke dissipating into the air. They offer no real justice or relief. Alliteration - 'helpless' and 'smoke' adds emphasis to the image.
    *   *Doth me no right:*  They do not bring her justice, repair her honor, or ease her pain.

*   **"The remedy indeed to do me good"**:
    *   *The remedy indeed*: This signals a shift in thought. She is now proposing a solution.
    *   *To do me good*: This phrase clarifies that the remedy is not just about justice, but about restoring something within herself.

*   **"Is to let forth my foul-defiled blood."**:
    *   *Let forth my foul-defiled blood:* This is the climax and the tragic conclusion. Lucrece believes the only way to cleanse herself of the stain of the rape is through suicide, through the shedding of her "foul-defiled blood." This is a stark and disturbing image, suggesting that she sees herself as permanently tainted. Alliteration - 'foul' and 'defiled' emphasizes the intensity of the defilement in Lucrece's eyes.

**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza expresses Lucrece's profound despair and her belief that she is irreparably damaged by the rape. She recognizes the futility of words to restore her honor or ease her pain. She has railed against the events and circumstances that led to the rape but ultimately sees death as the only "remedy" for her defilement. She has internalised the shame of the crime and views herself as unclean, unworthy of life.

**Literary Devices:**

*   **Repetition (Anaphora):** The repeated phrase "In vain" emphasizes the futility of Lucrece's actions and thoughts.
*   **Metaphor:** "Helpless smoke of words" is a powerful metaphor that illustrates the ineffectiveness of her lamentations.
*   **Alliteration:** "Helpless smoke", "foul-defiled blood".
*   **Personification:** "Uncheerful Night" gives human-like qualities to the night, making it complicit in the crime.
*   **Imagery:** The image of letting forth her "foul-defiled blood" is a strong and visceral image.
*   **Contrast:** The contrast between the futile "smoke of words" and the decisive action of letting blood highlights the shift in Lucrece's thinking.

In summary, this stanza encapsulates Lucrece's tragic realization that words are meaningless in the face of her defilement, leading her to the desperate conclusion that only death can restore her honor. It is a powerful and poignant expression of shame, despair, and the destructive power of patriarchal values.
