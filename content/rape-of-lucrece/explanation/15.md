# Stanza 15 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
But she, that never coped with stranger eyes,
Could pick no meaning from their parling looks,
Nor read the subtle-shining secrecies
Writ in the glassy margents of such books:
She touch'd no unknown baits, nor fear'd no hooks;
Nor could she moralize his wanton sight,
More than his eyes were open'd to the light.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
This stanza from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* describes Lucrece's innocence and naivet√© in the face of Tarquin's seductive advances. Let's break it down line by line:

* **"But she, that never coped with stranger eyes,"** This establishes Lucrece's inexperience.  "Coped" here means "engaged," or "dealt with." She's never had to navigate the complexities of flirtation or seduction from unfamiliar men.  The emphasis is on her lack of previous encounters with such suggestive gazes.

* **"Could pick no meaning from their parling looks,"** Tarquin's eyes are described as "parling," meaning speaking or conversing.  Lucrece, however, is unable to decipher the meaning behind his suggestive glances.  She lacks the experience to understand the nonverbal communication of flirtation.

* **"Nor read the subtle-shining secrecies / Writ in the glassy margents of such books:"** This is a powerful metaphor.  Tarquin's eyes are compared to "books" whose "subtle-shining secrecies" (hidden meanings) are written in the "glassy margents" (the margins or borders, reflecting like glass). The metaphor suggests that experienced women might read these unspoken messages like text on a page, but Lucrece cannot.  The "glassy" quality emphasizes the alluring but potentially deceptive nature of Tarquin's gaze.

* **"She touch'd no unknown baits, nor fear'd no hooks;"** This continues the fishing metaphor introduced subtly in the previous lines.  Lucrece has never encountered the manipulative tactics of seduction; she's unfamiliar with the "baits" (lures) and "hooks" (traps) used to ensnare her.  The imagery reinforces her innocence and inexperience.

* **"Nor could she moralize his wanton sight,"**  "Moralize" here means to interpret or find a meaning in. Lucrece is unable to understand or interpret the lasciviousness ("wanton sight") in Tarquin's gaze. Her purity prevents her from recognizing his malicious intent.

* **"More than his eyes were open'd to the light."** This final line is a concise and impactful comparison. Tarquin's eyes are "open'd to the light" - they clearly see their goal (Lucrece).  However, Lucrece's innocence prevents her from seeing the dark intention behind his gaze; she perceives only the surface level.  It highlights the stark contrast between their states of awareness.

**Literary Devices:**

* **Metaphor:**  The extended metaphor comparing Tarquin's eyes to a book with hidden meanings and to a fisherman's bait and hook is central to the stanza.
* **Personification:**  Tarquin's eyes are personified; they "parle" (speak) and are "open'd to the light."
* **Imagery:**  Vivid sensory details, such as "subtle-shining secrecies," "glassy margents," "unknown baits," and "hooks," create a strong visual and tactile impression.
* **Antithesis:** The final line uses antithesis (contrasting ideas) to emphasize the difference between Tarquin's awareness and Lucrece's naivete.


**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza powerfully portrays Lucrece's complete vulnerability to Tarquin's manipulation. Her innocence and lack of experience leave her incapable of recognizing the danger inherent in his seductive advances.  The stanza contrasts her purity and lack of understanding with Tarquin's calculated and predatory intentions. It sets the stage for the tragic events to follow by showing Lucrece's defenselessness against a seasoned seducer.
