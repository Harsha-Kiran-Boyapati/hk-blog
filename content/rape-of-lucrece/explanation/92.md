# Stanza 92 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
'To thee, to thee, my heaved-up hands appeal,
Not to seducing lust, thy rash relier:
I sue for exiled majesty's repeal;
Let him return, and flattering thoughts retire:
His true respect will prison false desire,
And wipe the dim mist from thy doting eyne,
That thou shalt see thy state and pity mine.'
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down Stanza 92 from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece*, line by line, then look at the overall meaning and literary devices:

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"To thee, to thee, my heaved-up hands appeal,"**
    *   **"To thee, to thee"**:  This is an **apostrophe**, a direct address to someone or something that is not physically present or, in this case, a specific aspect of the present person (Tarquin). It's a plea, emphasizing her desperation. The repetition of "thee" heightens the emotional intensity.
    *   **"my heaved-up hands appeal"**: A classic gesture of supplication and prayer. "Heaved-up hands" conveys the physical act of begging, reaching out for help.  "Appeal" emphasizes she's not demanding but pleading.

*   **"Not to seducing lust, thy rash relier:"**
    *   **"Not to seducing lust"**: A direct contrast to whom/what she *doesn't* appeal to. She's differentiating between Tarquin's true self and his overwhelming lust.  "Seducing" highlights the deceptive and manipulative nature of lust.
    *   **"thy rash relier"**:  "Thy" refers back to Tarquin.  "Rash relier" means something he relies on impulsively and recklessly.  This line identifies lust as the reckless force guiding Tarquin's actions. This also personifies "lust".

*   **"I sue for exiled majesty's repeal;"**
    *   **"I sue"**: Again, a plea, but now more formal and legalistic. "Sue" suggests a formal request or petition.
    *   **"for exiled majesty's repeal"**:  "Exiled majesty" refers to Tarquin's inherent nobility, his potential for greatness, which has been banished by his lust.  "Repeal" suggests the lifting of a banishment, a restoration of his true self. Lucrece is asking that Tarquin's former nobility be restored.

*   **"Let him return, and flattering thoughts retire:"**
    *   **"Let him return"**:  A direct request for Tarquin's true, noble self to come back.
    *   **"and flattering thoughts retire"**:  "Flattering thoughts" are the seductive, deceptive ideas and rationalizations that fueled his lust. "Retire" suggests they should withdraw and disappear.

*   **"His true respect will prison false desire,"**
    *   **"His true respect"**: Referring to Tarquin's innate sense of honor, his potential for moral behavior.
    *   **"will prison false desire"**:  A metaphor.  "Prison" suggests containment, control, and restraint. The idea is that Tarquin's inherent respect and nobility can overpower and subdue his lust ("false desire").

*   **"And wipe the dim mist from thy doting eyne,"**
    *   **"wipe the dim mist from thy doting eyne"**:  A metaphorical cleansing of perception. "Dim mist" represents the clouded judgment caused by lust. "Doting eyne" (archaic for eyes) suggests that lust has made Tarquin foolish and infatuated.  Lucrece wishes he could see clearly again.

*   **"That thou shalt see thy state and pity mine."**
    *   **"That thou shalt see thy state"**: Lucrece hopes Tarquin will recognize the gravity of his actions and the damage he has done. "State" refers to his moral condition and his position in society (which he has jeopardized).
    *   **"and pity mine"**: Lucrece desires his empathy and understanding of the immense suffering he has inflicted upon her.

**Overall Meaning:**

In this stanza, Lucrece isn't speaking directly to Tarquin in his current, lust-driven state. Instead, she's appealing to the potential for good that she believes still exists within him. She begs for his better nature to reassert itself, displacing the overwhelming lust that has consumed him. She pleads for his true nobility to return, so that he can see the error of his ways, understand the consequences of his actions, and, ultimately, feel remorse for the pain he has inflicted upon her. She hopes for him to be freed from his lustful desire. She also wants him to be able to see the gravity of the situation, the state he has put her in, and for him to then pity her. The stanza is a desperate attempt to reach the man she believes is buried beneath his current destructive behavior.

**Literary Devices Highlighted:**

*   **Apostrophe**: Direct address to Tarquin's "thee"
*   **Personification**: Giving human qualities to abstract concepts like "lust" and "respect."
*   **Metaphor**:  Comparing "false desire" to a prisoner being held captive, and the "dim mist" of lust to a clouded perception.
*   **Repetition**: "To thee, to thee" emphasizes the desperation of her plea.
*   **Imagery**: Visual images such as "heaved-up hands," "dim mist," and "doting eyne" contribute to the stanza's emotional impact.
*   **Archaism**: The use of "eyne" (eyes) gives the language a formal, elevated tone.
*   **Alliteration:** A subtle alliteration like "flattering thoughts" adds a musicality to the lines.

The stanza is a complex and powerful expression of Lucrece's internal struggle, her hope for redemption, and her profound sense of injustice. It encapsulates the tragic core of the poem: the conflict between virtue and vice, and the devastating consequences of unchecked desire.
