## Original Stanza
```
‚ÄúCourageous Roman, do not steep thy heart
In such relenting dew of lamentations,
But kneel with me, and help to bear thy part

By our strong arms from forth her fair streets chased.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Let's break down this stanza from Shakespeare's "The Rape of Lucrece":

**Individual Breakdown:**

*   **"Courageous Roman, do not steep thy heart"**: This is a direct address to Lucius Junius Brutus, a Roman nobleman, urging him to stop being overwhelmed by grief. "Steep" means to soak or immerse, implying he's drowning in his sorrow. The use of the word "Courageous" is a flattering way to encourage him and draw him in.

*   **"In such relenting dew of lamentations"**: This explains what he shouldn't "steep" his heart in. "Relenting dew of lamentations" is a metaphor, comparing Brutus's tears and grief to a soft, yielding moisture. "Lamentations" refers to expressions of grief, sorrow, and mourning. "Relenting" suggests that the tears are making him weak.

*   **"But kneel with me, and help to bear thy part"**: This is a call to action, urging Brutus to join the speaker in their efforts. "Kneel with me" is a literal act of supplication, signifying a request for help and seeking divine intervention. "Bear thy part" means to fulfill his role in the forthcoming actions.

*   **"To rouse our Roman gods with invocations"**: This specifies their immediate action: praying to the Roman gods. "Rouse" implies awakening the gods from a state of indifference. "Invocations" are prayers or calls for help, a plea to the gods.

*   **"That they will suffer these abominations,"**: This explains the purpose of the invocations: to persuade the gods to intervene against the "abominations," referring to the rape of Lucrece and the resulting disgrace.

*   **"Since Rome herself in them doth stand disgraced,"**: This provides the reasoning behind the invocation, explaining why the gods should act. It states that the heinous acts dishonor Rome itself, not just Lucrece. This uses the literary device of **synecdoche**, where "Rome" represents the Roman people and the entire state, while "them" refers to the actions of Tarquin and the other corrupt individuals.

*   **"By our strong arms from forth her fair streets chased."**: This outlines the ultimate goal: to drive the perpetrators, specifically the perpetrator, Tarquin, and anyone who enables him, from Rome. "Her fair streets" emphasizes the beauty and innocence of the city that is being violated. "Chased" implies swift and forceful expulsion.

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza is a rallying cry. It's a call to action for Brutus to overcome his grief and join the speaker (likely a close companion of Lucrece or a key figure in the plot) in seeking vengeance. The speaker urges Brutus to turn from private sorrow to public action. They will appeal to the Roman gods for help and then take matters into their own hands, driving out those who have disgraced Rome. This highlights the shift from personal tragedy to a political and moral imperative to act. The stanza is filled with emotional intensity and a sense of urgency, setting the stage for the revolt against Tarquin and the establishment of the Roman Republic.

**Literary Devices Highlights:**

*   **Metaphor**: "relenting dew of lamentations" (comparing tears to a yielding substance)
*   **Synecdoche**: "Rome" (representing the Roman people and state)
*   **Direct Address**: "Courageous Roman"
*   **Alliteration**: "But kneel with me, and help to bear thy part"
*   **Imagery**: "fair streets" evokes visual image
