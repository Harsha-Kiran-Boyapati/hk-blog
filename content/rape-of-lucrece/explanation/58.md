# Stanza 58 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
Her hair, like golden threads, play'd with her breath;
O modest wantons! wanton modesty!
Showing life's triumph in the map of death,
And death's dim look in life's mortality:
Each in her sleep themselves so beautify,
As if between them twain there were no strife,
But that life lived in death, and death in life.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

*   **"O modest wantons! wanton modesty!"**
    *   **Meaning:** This is a paradoxical statement. It suggests a conflict between Lucrece's inherent virtue (modesty) and the vulnerability and allure she presents even in sleep, which could be seen as provocative (wanton).

    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Oxymoron:** "modest wantons" and "wanton modesty" - Juxtaposes contradictory terms to create a complex and thought-provoking effect. It forces the reader to consider the ambiguity of her beauty and innocence.

*   **"Showing life's triumph in the map of death,"**

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza is a meditation on the complex relationship between beauty, innocence, life, and death. Shakespeare uses Lucrece's sleeping form as a canvas to explore these themes. He emphasizes the paradoxical nature of her beauty, highlighting how her "modest" appearance can also be perceived as "wanton" or provocative. More profoundly, he explores the idea that life and death are not mutually exclusive concepts but are intertwined, with each existing within the other. The stanza sets the stage for the tragedy to come by subtly foreshadowing Lucrece's vulnerability and the inevitability of mortality, even within the most beautiful and innocent existence. Her beauty, even in sleep, is both a source of her allure and a potential catalyst for the violence that will befall her. It highlights the precarious balance between beauty, virtue, and the ever-present threat of death. It creates a sense of foreboding, reminding the reader that even in the most serene moments, danger can lurk.
