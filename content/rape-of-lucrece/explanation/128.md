**Overall Meaning and Interpretation:**

This stanza functions as a powerful condemnation of "Opportunity" (personified), which is depicted as an enticing yet ultimately destructive force. The stanza argues that the fleeting pleasures and advantages gained through seizing immoral or ill-advised opportunities inevitably lead to lasting shame, suffering, dishonor, and regret.  The core message revolves around the paradoxical human tendency to pursue things that are known to be harmful.

The repetitive use of antithesis throughout the first four lines underscores the dramatic reversal of fortune that awaits those who succumb to the allure of Opportunity. The rhetorical question in the final two lines serves to challenge the reader to contemplate this inherent human flaw. The stanza paints a picture of an individual chasing fleeting desires while facing ultimate misery.
