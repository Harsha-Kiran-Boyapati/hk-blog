# Stanza 80 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
Yet, foul night-waking cat, he doth but dally,
While in his hold-fast foot the weak mouse panteth:
Her sad behavior feeds his vulture folly,
A swallowing gulf that even in plenty wanteth:
His ear her prayers admits, but his heart granteth
No penetrable entrance to her plaining:
Tears harden lust, though marble wear with raining.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **Line 1: Yet, foul night-waking cat, he doth but dally,**

    *   **"Yet, foul night-waking cat"**: This is a simile comparing Tarquin to a cat. "Foul" establishes him as morally repugnant, "night-waking" emphasizes his nocturnal, predatory nature. Cats are naturally associated with hunting small prey in the night, further driving the violent and stealthy nature of Tarquin's actions. "Dally" means to play or trifle with something, here suggesting Tarquin is toying with Lucrece before the "kill."
    *   **"he doth but dally"**: This means he's only playing around; he's not yet committing the full act of rape. He's enjoying the chase and Lucrece's fear.

*   **Line 2: While in his hold-fast foot the weak mouse panteth:**

    *   **"While in his hold-fast foot"**: A continuation of the animalistic metaphor. The "foot" of the cat is holding the mouse captive. "Hold-fast" implies a powerful, inescapable grip. It highlights Tarquin's control over Lucrece's fate.
    *   **"the weak mouse panteth"**: Lucrece is compared to a "weak mouse." This reinforces her vulnerability and powerlessness against Tarquin's strength. "Panteth" conveys her fear, anxiety, and struggle for breath, as she realizes what is happening.

*   **Line 3: Her sad behavior feeds his vulture folly,**

    *   **"Her sad behavior"**: Refers to Lucrece's distress, her pleading, and her evident fear.
    *   **"feeds his vulture folly"**: This is a powerful metaphor. Tarquin's "folly" (his foolish, wicked lust) is compared to a vulture that is being fed by Lucrece's sadness. Vultures are scavengers, feeding on the dead or dying. The more distressed Lucrece becomes, the more his lust grows stronger. It is also associated with the idea of death and decay, foreshadowing the destruction to come.

*   **Line 4: A swallowing gulf that even in plenty wanteth:**

    *   **"A swallowing gulf"**: Metaphor for Tarquin's lust. It's an insatiable abyss that consumes everything. "Swallowing" suggests the destructive and all-consuming nature of his desire.
    *   **"that even in plenty wanteth"**: Even when surrounded by abundance, it always lacks. This highlights the idea that lust is never satisfied. Even if Tarquin obtains Lucrece, his desire will not be fulfilled, and will search for another victim.

*   **Line 5: His ear her prayers admits, but his heart granteth**

    *   **"His ear her prayers admits"**: Suggests that Tarquin hears Lucrece's pleas for mercy, but only acknowledges them.
    *   **"but his heart granteth"**: He doesn't allow her prayers into his heart. He's acknowledging her words, but not changing his behavior.

*   **Line 6: No penetrable entrance to her plaining:**

    *   **"No penetrable entrance to her plaining"**: Tarquin's heart is impenetrable to her lamentation. "Plaining" is her complaint. It implies his heart is impenetrable and indifferent. There is no way for her sadness to reach and affect him.

*   **Line 7: Tears harden lust, though marble wear with raining.**

    *   **"Tears harden lust"**: This is the paradox. Lucrece's tears, which should inspire pity, only intensify Tarquin's lust.
    *   **"though marble wear with raining"**: This is a simile. The tears would eventually wear down even the toughest materials (marble). This emphasizes the power of tears in general. It contrasts sharply with the previous clause, making it clear that Tarquin's lust is so strong it is immune to the softening effects of tears.

**Overall Meaning:**

Stanza 80 vividly portrays Tarquin's relentless pursuit of Lucrece and her utter powerlessness. It emphasizes his predatory nature and insatiable lust, which are fueled by her fear and distress. He acknowledges her pleas but remains unmoved, his heart hardened against any sense of compassion. The stanza underscores the tragic irony that her very suffering only intensifies his desire, highlighting the destructive and dehumanizing nature of uncontrolled lust. The final line provides a bleak commentary on the strength of lust, surpassing the effects of tears on a hardened stone.

**Literary Devices:**

*   **Metaphor:** Tarquin's lust as a "swallowing gulf."
*   **Simile:** Tarquin as a "foul night-waking cat," Lucrece's tears wearing down marble.
*   **Paradox:** "Tears harden lust," highlighting the counterintuitive effect of her suffering.
*   **Imagery:** The animalistic imagery of the cat and mouse, the vulture feeding, and the swallowing gulf create a strong, visceral sense of the predatory nature of the situation.
*   **Alliteration:** "Hold-fast foot" and "Vulture folly."
*   **Personification**: "His ear her prayers admits, but his heart granteth." (Giving human qualities to abstract ideas.)
