# Stanza 2 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
Haply that name of 'chaste' unhappily set
This bateless edge on his keen appetite;
When Collatine unwisely did not let
To praise the clear unmatched red and white
Which triumph'd in that sky of his delight,
Where mortal stars, as bright as heaven's beauties,
With pure aspects did him peculiar duties.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Let's break down Shakespeare's stanza from *The Rape of Lucrece*, line by line, identifying literary devices:

* **Line 1: "Haply that name of 'chaste' unhappily set / This bateless edge on his keen appetite;"**

    * **Haply:** Perhaps, maybe.  This introduces uncertainty.
    * **"name of 'chaste'":**  Refers to Lucrece's reputation for chastity.  The use of quotation marks emphasizes the word as a label or description.
    * **"unhappily set":** Ironically or unfortunately caused.  This creates dramatic irony; Lucrece's chastity is the very thing that fuels Tarquin's desire.
    * **"This bateless edge":** This refers to the unrelenting sharpness of Tarquin's desire, a "bateless" edge meaning one that is never dulled.  This is a **metaphor**.
    * **"keen appetite":**  Tarquin's intense, insatiable lust.

* **Line 2-3: "When Collatine unwisely did not let / To praise the clear unmatched red and white..."**

    * **"When Collatine unwisely did not let":** This describes Collatine's foolish act of praising Lucrece's beauty.  "Did not let" means he refrained from nothing in his praise.
    * **"To praise the clear unmatched red and white":** This is a description of Lucrece's beauty ‚Äì the "red and white" referring to her complexion (red cheeks and white skin). The words "clear" and "unmatched" highlight her exceptional beauty.

* **Line 4-6: "Which triumph'd in that sky of his delight, / Where mortal stars, as bright as heaven's beauties, / With pure aspects did him peculiar duties."**

    * **"Which triumph'd in that sky of his delight":**  Her beauty "triumphed" or reigned supreme in the "sky" of Collatine's admiration. "Sky" is a **metaphor** for his affections or gaze.
    * **"Where mortal stars, as bright as heaven's beauties":** Lucrece is likened to stars ("mortal stars"), surpassing even heavenly beauty. This is a **metaphor** and **simile**.
    * **"With pure aspects did him peculiar duties":**  Her beauty captivated Collatine completely; her "pure aspects" (appearance and demeanor) "did him peculiar duties" ‚Äì meaning, they compelled him to focus solely on her and praise her, almost as if they were bound by some involuntary obligation.


**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza establishes the crucial catalyst for the tragedy.  Collatine's innocent, albeit ill-advised, boasting about Lucrece's beauty to Tarquin inadvertently ignites Tarquin's lust.  The "name of 'chaste'" ironically fuels his desire, a prime example of the perverse and destructive nature of male desire in the poem.  Shakespeare uses vivid imagery and metaphor, portraying Lucrece's beauty as overwhelmingly captivating, creating an atmosphere where an innocent act of praise sets in motion a catastrophic chain of events. The language emphasizes the power of both beauty and the unchecked, potentially violent nature of male desire.
