# Stanza 44 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
The locks between her chamber and his will,
Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
But, as they open, they all rate his ill,
Which drives the creeping thief to some regard:
The threshold grates the door to have him heard;
Night-wandering weasels shriek to see him there;
They fright him, yet he still pursues his fear.
```

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza portrays Tarquin's approach to Lucrece's chamber as a journey of transgression.  The physical barriers (the locks) and the environment itself (threshold, weasels) are personified, turning into agents of condemnation and warning. The imagery paints a picture of stealth, violation, and a growing sense of the evil of Tarquin's intentions. Despite being aware of the sin he is committing, and the warning signals from the outside world, Tarquin pushes forward, compelled by his lust.  The stanza emphasizes both the physical act of the break-in and the moral decay within Tarquin. The contrast of his internal desire to the external warnings makes this stanza very poignant.
