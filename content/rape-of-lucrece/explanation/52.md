# Stanza 52 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
This said, his guilty hand pluck'd up the latch,
And with his knee the door he opens wide.
The dove sleeps fast that this night-owl will catch:
Thus treason works ere traitors be espied.
Who sees the lurking serpent steps aside;
But she, sound sleeping, fearing no such thing,
Lies at the mercy of his mortal sting.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Let's break down Stanza 52 of Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* line by line and then put it all together.

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"This said, his guilty hand pluck'd up the latch,"**

    *   **"This said"**: This refers to the previous stanza where Tarquin presumably spoke to himself, justifying his actions.  He has talked himself into it.
    *   **"his guilty hand pluck'd up the latch"**:  The action itself.  His "guilty hand" emphasizes his awareness of the wrongness of his actions. "Pluck'd" is a stronger, more forceful word than simply "lifted," suggesting urgency and a lack of gentleness.
    *   **Literary Devices**:  **Alliteration** of "hand" and "pluck'd" subtly emphasizes the physicality of the act.

*   **"And with his knee the door he opens wide."**

    *   This continues the description of his forceful entry. Using his knee shows a lack of delicacy or stealth; he doesn't care about being quiet or gentle. "Opens wide" is a simple but effective phrase that implies the enormity of his intended violation.
    *   **Literary Devices**: **Caesura**: The pause after 'knee' breaks up the flow, drawing attention to the brutal action.

*   **"The dove sleeps fast that this night-owl will catch:"**

    *   **Metaphor**: This line introduces a powerful metaphor. Lucrece is the innocent "dove," sleeping peacefully, unaware of the danger.  Tarquin is the predatory "night-owl," hunting under the cover of darkness.
    *   **"Sleeps fast"** reinforces Lucrece's vulnerability and lack of awareness.
    *   **Literary Devices**: **Metaphor**: As mentioned. **Symbolism**: Dove for innocence, owl for predator and darkness. **Foreshadowing**: Clearly indicates impending danger for Lucrece.

*   **"Thus treason works ere traitors be espied."**

    *   This is a general observation.  Treason (betrayal) operates best when it's unseen and unexpected. Tarquin's betrayal of Lucrece's hospitality and their friendship is likened to treason against a state.
    *   **"Ere traitors be espied"** emphasizes the secrecy and deception involved.
    *   **Literary Devices**: **Generalization**: Moves from the specific scene to a broader truth.

*   **"Who sees the lurking serpent steps aside;"**

    *   A further generalization, building on the previous line. If you see a threat, you avoid it. The "lurking serpent" is another symbolic representation of danger, specifically hidden danger.
    *   **Literary Devices**: **Metaphor**: Serpent as hidden danger. **Allusion**: Serpent to the story of the Garden of Eden.

*   **"But she, sound sleeping, fearing no such thing,"**

    *   This contrasts with the previous line.  Lucrece, "sound sleeping" (repetition from line 3, emphasizing her unawareness), is not aware of any danger and therefore cannot protect herself.  "Fearing no such thing" highlights her trust and innocence.

*   **"Lies at the mercy of his mortal sting."**

    *   The culmination of the stanza.  Lucrece is completely vulnerable, "at the mercy" of Tarquin.  "Mortal sting" refers to the rape and the potential consequences (loss of honor, societal ruin, possibly death).  The "sting" is a violent, painful image.
    *   **Literary Devices**: **Metaphor**: "Mortal sting" represents the rape and its consequences. **Ironic Foreshadowing**: Because while the rape is his "mortal sting", Lucrece's suicide will be a "mortal sting" to him.

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza builds intense suspense and emphasizes Lucrece's utter vulnerability. Tarquin, fueled by lust and self-justification, moves from thought to action, breaking into her room with force.  The metaphors of the dove and owl, the serpent, and the mortal sting all contribute to a sense of impending doom. The lines emphasize that betrayal thrives in darkness and that Lucrece, unsuspecting and defenseless, is now completely at the mercy of Tarquin's violent desires. The stanza underscores the injustice and horror of the situation. It's not just about a physical act but about the betrayal of trust and the violation of innocence.
