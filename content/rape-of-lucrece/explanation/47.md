```
But all these poor forbiddings could not stay him;
He in the worst sense construes their denial:
The doors, the wind, the glove, that did delay him,
He takes for accidental things of trial;
Or as those bars which stop the hourly dial,
Who with a lingering slay his course doth let,
Till every minute pays the hour his debt.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
This stanza from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* depicts Tarquin's relentless pursuit of Lucrece, despite obstacles. Let's break down each line:

* **"But all these poor forbiddings could not stay him;"**  This line establishes the central conflict.  "Poor forbiddings" refers to the subtle resistances Lucrece offers ‚Äì perhaps a hesitant demeanor, closed doors, or the wind delaying him.  The word "poor" suggests the weakness of these attempts to deter him, highlighting Tarquin's overwhelming force.

* **"He in the worst sense construes their denial:"** This is crucial. Tarquin doesn't interpret Lucrece's subtle refusals as genuine rejections. Instead, ("in the worst sense construes") he perversely interprets them as a game, a coy form of encouragement, or a test of his determination. This demonstrates his arrogant disregard for her agency.

* **"The doors, the wind, the glove, that did delay him,"** This line provides concrete examples of the minor obstacles Tarquin encounters.  The "glove" could be a detail meant to suggest a dropped item that briefly hinders him, furthering the image of subtle resistance.  These are presented as seemingly insignificant impediments.

* **"He takes for accidental things of trial;"** Tarquin rationalizes the delays, viewing them not as deliberate rejections but as mere "accidental things of trial"‚Äîchallenges to be overcome, rather than signs that he should desist.  This is a form of **metonymy**, where the obstacles represent Lucrece's rejection.

* **"Or as those bars which stop the hourly dial,"** This line introduces a **metaphor**. The "bars" that stop the hourly dial represent the minor obstacles.  The dial itself symbolizes the unstoppable progress of time, and the the "bars" delaying its progress suggest the temporary nature of Lucrece's resistance ‚Äì it's delaying the inevitable.

* **"Who with a lingering slay his course doth let,"**  The "dial" (personified as "who") is actively involved in delaying ("doth let") Tarquin's advance. "Lingering slay" is an oxymoron, suggesting a slow, methodical killing of time. This further emphasises Tarquin‚Äôs determination; even the obstacles only serve to make him more deliberate.

* **"Till every minute pays the hour his debt."** This final line concludes the metaphor.  Just as each minute eventually contributes to the completion of an hour, so too will each obstacle eventually lead to Tarquin's success in violating Lucrece.  It suggests an inexorable, almost deterministic march toward rape.

## Overall Meaning
The stanza depicts Tarquin's unwavering determination to achieve his goal. He refuses to acknowledge Lucrece's refusals, actively misinterpreting any obstacle as a mere test or delay on the inevitable path to his conquest.  The imagery of the clock emphasizes the unstoppable nature of his pursuit, highlighting the vulnerability of Lucrece in the face of his unrelenting will.  The use of metaphor and personification enhances the feeling of inevitability, foreshadowing the tragic rape to come.  The poem uses these devices to critique male entitlement and predatory behavior.

## Literary Devices
- **Personification:** The wind is given agency, as if it actively tries to stop Tarquin.
- **Metaphor:** The torch represents both literal light and Tarquin‚Äôs moral guidance.
- **Symbolism:** The unwilling portals, vents, and wind all symbolize resistance to Tarquin‚Äôs crime; his own breath symbolizes the triumph of lust over conscience.
