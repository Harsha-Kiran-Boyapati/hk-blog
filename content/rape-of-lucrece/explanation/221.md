# Stanza 221 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
‚ÄúFor even as subtle Sinon here is painted,
So sober-sad, so weary, and so mild,
As if with grief or travail he had fainted,
To me came Tarquin armed too, beguiled
With outward honesty, but yet defiled
With inward vice. As Priam him did cherish,
So did I Tarquin; so my Troy did perish.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down this powerful stanza from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece*:

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"For even as subtle Sinon here is painted,"**
    *   **Literal Meaning:** Just as the cunning Sinon is depicted in this painting (presumably a painting that is present in Lucrece's house).
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Allusion:** This line refers to Sinon, a Greek character from the Trojan War. Sinon tricked the Trojans into bringing the Trojan Horse inside their city walls. He pretended to be a deserter and claimed the horse was an offering to the gods. This allusion immediately sets up a parallel between Sinon's deception and Tarquin's.
        *   **Imagery:** The word "painted" creates a visual image and suggests that Sinon's deceit is not just a matter of words, but also of carefully crafted appearance.

*   **"So sober-sad, so weary, and so mild,"**
    *   **Literal Meaning:** Sinon appears to be serious, sad, tired, and gentle. These are all characteristics that mask his true intentions.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Alliteration:** The repetition of the "s" sound in "sober-sad" creates a soft, deceptive effect.
        *   **Asyndeton:** The omission of conjunctions (like "and") between "sober-sad, so weary, and so mild" creates a sense of quick accumulation of deceptive qualities.
        *   **Imagery:** These adjectives paint a picture of a man who inspires pity and trust.

*   **"As if with grief or travail he had fainted,"**
    *   **Literal Meaning:** He looks as though he's exhausted and weak from sorrow or hard work. This emphasizes his vulnerability, which is part of his trickery.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Simile:** The use of "as if" creates a comparison, suggesting that Sinon's appearance is deliberately misleading.

*   **"To me came Tarquin armed too, beguiled"**
    *   **Literal Meaning:** Tarquin, like Sinon, arrived at Lucrece's home wearing a mask. He was seemingly tricked by (or tricked people into thinking) he was honest.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Parallel Structure:** The connection between Sinon and Tarquin is reinforced. "To me came Tarquin" mirrors the implied arrival of Sinon through the painting.
        *   **Juxtaposition:** "Armed" is a key word, juxtaposed with "beguiled". This highlights the hidden threat beneath the surface of innocence.

*   **"With outward honesty, but yet defiled"**
    *   **Literal Meaning:** He presented an appearance of honesty, but was actually corrupted and morally tainted inside.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Antithesis:** "Outward honesty" and "inward vice" create a direct contrast, emphasizing the hypocrisy of Tarquin.

*   **"With inward vice. As Priam him did cherish,"**
    *   **Literal Meaning:** Just as King Priam of Troy trusted and welcomed Sinon into his city,
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Allusion:** Continues the allusion to the Trojan War, solidifying the parallel between Sinon's deception and Tarquin's actions.
        *   **Simile:** "As Priam him did cherish" uses "as" to draw a direct comparison.

*   **"So did I Tarquin; so my Troy did perish."**
    *   **Literal Meaning:** So too, did I (Lucrece) trust and welcome Tarquin; and as a result, my virtue (my "Troy") was destroyed/ruined.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Parallel Structure:** Mirrors the previous line ("As Priam him did cherish / So did I Tarquin").
        *   **Metaphor:** Lucrece's virtue/honor/chastity is equated with the city of Troy. The destruction of Troy symbolizes the loss of her honor.
        *   **Anaphora:** The repetition of "So" emphasizes the parallel between Priam's mistake and Lucrece's.
        *   **Irony:** The destruction of Troy came from within, from misplaced trust. Similarly, Lucrece's destruction comes from within her own household, from a guest she trusted.

**Overall Meaning:**

In this stanza, Lucrece draws a parallel between herself and the Trojans, and between Tarquin and Sinon. The painting of Sinon reminds her that she, like Priam, was deceived by outward appearances. Tarquin, like Sinon, pretended to be trustworthy, but was secretly harboring evil intentions.  Just as Sinon's deception led to the fall of Troy, Lucrece's misplaced trust in Tarquin led to the destruction of her own personal "Troy," meaning her virtue and honor. The stanza highlights the dangers of trusting appearances and the devastating consequences of deception. It underscores Lucrece's sense of responsibility (or at least, her perception of responsibility) for the tragedy that has befallen her. She sees herself as having made a fatal error in judgment. The stanza is filled with a sense of foreboding and tragic irony.
