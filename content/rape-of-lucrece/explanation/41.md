# Stanza 41 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
As corn o'ergrown by weeds, so heedful fear
Is almost choked by unresisted lust.
Away he steals with open listening ear,
Full of foul hope and full of fond mistrust;
Both which, as servitors to the unjust,
So cross him with their opposite persuasion,
That now he vows a league, and now invasion.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
This stanza from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* depicts Tarquin's internal conflict as he approaches Lucrece's chamber. Let's break it down line by line:

* **"As corn o'ergrown by weeds, so heedful fear / Is almost choked by unresisted lust."**  This is a **simile** comparing Tarquin's fear to corn choked by weeds.  "Heedful fear" represents Tarquin's awareness of the wrong he's about to commit.  "Unresisted lust" is his overpowering desire, which is presented as a stronger force, metaphorically overwhelming his conscience.  The imagery emphasizes the struggle within Tarquin‚Äîhis fear is present but severely weakened.

* **"Away he steals with open listening ear,"**  This line describes Tarquin's stealthy approach.  The "open listening ear" suggests both his attentiveness to potential danger and his eagerness to hear any sign of Lucrece's presence (or absence).  This subtle detail adds to the suspense and builds the tension.

* **"Full of foul hope and full of fond mistrust;"** This line highlights the paradoxical nature of Tarquin's state of mind. "Foul hope" refers to his wicked anticipation of success in his crime, while "fond mistrust" suggests a lingering doubt or fear of failure or discovery.  The juxtaposition of "foul" and "fond" amplifies the internal conflict.  The use of "full of" emphasizes the overwhelming nature of these conflicting emotions.

* **"Both which, as servitors to the unjust,"** This line personifies "foul hope" and "fond mistrust," portraying them as servants attending to Tarquin's unjust intentions.  This personification allows Shakespeare to more easily portray the internal conflict as a battle of wills.

* **"So cross him with their opposite persuasion,"** This line indicates how these conflicting emotions continuously pull Tarquin in different directions, preventing him from acting decisively. "Opposite persuasion" emphasizes the contrasting nature of hope and mistrust, making his decision-making even more torturous.

* **"That now he vows a league, and now invasion."** This line reveals the oscillating nature of Tarquin's intentions.  "League" suggests a peaceful approach, possibly implying a desire to somehow reconcile his lust with his conscience, while "invasion" clearly refers to his violent plan. The repetition of "now" highlights the rapid back-and-forth of his thoughts.


**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza powerfully portrays Tarquin's inner turmoil in the face of his impending crime.  His lust is a dominant force, but it's not without internal resistance. The conflict isn't a simple moral struggle; it's a chaotic interplay of conflicting emotions, each pulling him in different directions.  The vivid imagery of the overgrown corn and the personified "servitors" paints a picture of a man consumed by his desire yet plagued by doubt and fear, highlighting the psychological complexity of the villain.  Shakespeare masterfully uses literary devices to create suspense and illuminate the character's internal conflict.  The stanza serves as a build-up to the horrific act to follow, making the ensuing rape even more impactful.
