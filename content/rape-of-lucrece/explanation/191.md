# Stanza 191 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
Her letter now is sealed, and on it writ
‚ÄúAt Ardea to my lord with more than haste.‚Äù
The post attends, and she delivers it,
Charging the sour-faced groom to hie as fast
As lagging fowls before the northern blast.
Speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems;
Extremely still urgeth such extremes.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down stanza 191 of Shakespeare's 'The Rape of Lucrece' line by line, identifying literary devices and then providing an overall interpretation.

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **Line 1: "Her letter now is sealed, and on it writ"**

    *   **Meaning:** Lucrece has finished writing her letter to her husband, Collatine, and has sealed it. It's ready to be sent.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Simple, direct statement. Sets the scene and initiates the action. The passive voice ("is sealed," "on it writ") emphasizes Lucrece's lack of control, even in initiating this action.

*   **Line 2: "‚ÄúAt Ardea to my lord with more than haste.‚Äù"**

    *   **Meaning:** This is the address written on the letter. Ardea is where Collatine is stationed with the Roman army. The phrase "with more than haste" indicates extreme urgency.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Direct speech (within the poem) adds immediacy. The hyperbole of "more than haste" underscores the frantic nature of Lucrece's plea.

*   **Line 3: "The post attends, and she delivers it,"**

    *   **Meaning:** The messenger is ready, and Lucrece hands him the letter.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Straightforward action; the "post attends" uses personification.

*   **Line 4: "Charging the sour-faced groom to hie as fast"**

    *   **Meaning:** Lucrece commands the gloomy-looking servant (the groom, referring to a servant, often associated with horses) to hurry ("hie") as quickly as possible.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Characterization - "sour-faced groom" gives us a quick visual and hints at the emotional atmosphere. The use of "hie" is slightly archaic, lending a formal, almost biblical tone, even in a moment of urgency.

*   **Line 5: "As lagging fowls before the northern blast."**

    *   **Meaning:** She tells him to go as fast as birds fleeing a strong, freezing north wind. The birds are "lagging" indicating the wind is already impacting their progress.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Simile. The comparison to fleeing birds vividly illustrates the speed and desperation Lucrece wants the messenger to achieve. The "northern blast" is a powerful image of force and threat, mirrored by Lucrece's situation.

*   **Line 6: "Speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems;"**

    *   **Meaning:** Even the fastest possible speed seems insufficient to her. She perceives even incredible speed as "dull and slow."
    *   **Literary Devices:** Paradox and exaggeration. "Speed more than speed" is logically impossible, highlighting the intensity of Lucrece's anxiety. The subjective nature of time and speed is emphasized; her fear distorts her perception.

*   **Line 7: "Extremely still urgeth such extremes."**

    *   **Meaning:** Despite the impossibility of exceeding speed, she relentlessly urges him to go faster. The word "extremely still" contrasts and emphasizes the impossible request she's making.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Paradox again - "Extremely still urgeth" sounds self-contradictory. It highlights Lucrece's inner turmoil. She is urging the groom while at the same time the circumstances are not changing.

**Overall Meaning of the Stanza:**

This stanza focuses on Lucrece's desperate attempt to communicate her plight to her husband and her frantic impatience. She has written the letter and is now utterly consumed by the need to get it to Collatine with the utmost speed. Her urgency is so extreme that even the fastest possible conveyance seems inadequate. The language is filled with exaggerations, similes, and even paradoxes to emphasize Lucrece's state of panic and the distorted perception of time that arises from her fear. The stanza illustrates the power of the rape in distorting Lucrece's mind and the complete collapse of her agency. Despite the urgency, she is still "extremely still" and unable to move forward from what has occurred. The impossibility of her request mirrors the impossibility of undoing the violation she has suffered. The urgency underscores the dire situation and foreshadows the tragic outcome.
