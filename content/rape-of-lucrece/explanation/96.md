# Stanza 96 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
'So let thy thoughts, low vassals to thy state'--
No more,' quoth he; 'by heaven, I will not hear thee:
Yield to my love; if not, enforced hate,
Instead of love's coy touch, shall rudely tear thee;
That done, despitefully I mean to bear thee
Unto the base bed of some rascal groom,
To be thy partner in this shameful doom.'
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down Stanza 96 from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* line by line, then consider the overall meaning and literary devices:

**Line 1: 'So let thy thoughts, low vassals to thy state'**

*   **"So let thy thoughts..."** : This sets the context. Tarquin is interrupting Lucrece's plea (from the previous stanza). "So let thy thoughts" can be interpreted as "stop thinking like that" or "give up those thoughts." It's dismissive.
*   **"...low vassals to thy state..."**: This is a crucial metaphor.
    *   **"low vassals"**: Vassals are subjects, servants, those who owe allegiance to a higher power (in this case, Lucrece). They are described as "low," implying they are inferior and should be controlled. Tarquin is implying Lucrece should control her "thoughts" (i.e. her ideas about chastity and honor) as if they were just subordinates.
    *   **"thy state"**:  This refers to Lucrece's inner "state" or self - her honor, her self-control, her principles, her body.

    *   **Overall meaning of line 1**: Tarquin wants Lucrece to stop thinking about her honor or her principles as if they hold any power over her. He wants her to control those thoughts as easily as a ruler controls servants.

**Line 2: 'No more,' quoth he; 'by heaven, I will not hear thee:'**

*   **"No more,' quoth he..."**: This is a straightforward declaration. Tarquin is refusing to listen to Lucrece any further. "Quoth" is an archaic word for "said".
*   **"...by heaven, I will not hear thee"**:  He swears "by heaven" to emphasize the force of his resolve.  He emphatically refuses to listen to Lucrece's protests.

    *   **Overall meaning of line 2**: This line reinforces the end of any possibility of discussion. Tarquin makes a firm statement that he will not listen to Lucrece any further.

**Line 3: 'Yield to my love; if not, enforced hate,'**

*   **"Yield to my love..."**: This is the central demand. Tarquin is demanding that Lucrece surrender to his lust.
*   **"...if not, enforced hate..."**: This is the threat. He's saying that if she doesn't "yield to my love," he will replace his pretended love with "enforced hate" (i.e. hatred that is put into practice).

    *   **Overall meaning of line 3**: Tarquin states the ultimatum clearly: consent to his desires, or face the consequences of his hatred.

**Line 4: 'Instead of love's coy touch, shall rudely tear thee;'**

*   **"Instead of love's coy touch..."**: This creates a contrast between a gentle, playful (coy) love and the violence to come. "Coy touch" represents how Tarquin tries to portray his actions.
*   **"...shall rudely tear thee"**: This is the graphic threat of physical violence. The verb "tear" is brutal and suggests a violation far beyond a simple seduction. It signifies the potential literal tearing of her virginity.

    *   **Overall meaning of line 4**: Tarquin replaces his gentle and enticing behavior with the reality of physical assault. The words show the severity of his threat.

**Line 5: 'That done, despitefully I mean to bear thee'**

*   **"That done..."**: After the act of violence.
*   **"...despitefully I mean to bear thee"**: "Despitefully" means maliciously or with contempt. "Bear thee" means to carry or take her.

    *   **Overall meaning of line 5**: Tarquin is planning further acts of malice, beyond the initial rape. This sets the stage for the ultimate humiliation to come.

**Line 6: 'Unto the base bed of some rascal groom,'**

*   **"Unto the base bed..."**: "Base" implies low social status and morally debased. "Bed" represents the act of sexual intercourse.
*   **"...of some rascal groom"**: A "rascal groom" is a low-class servant or stable boy who is also a scoundrel.

    *   **Overall meaning of line 6**: Tarquin is planning to force Lucrece to sleep with a low-status servant, compounding the shame of the rape.

**Line 7: 'To be thy partner in this shameful doom.'**

*   **"To be thy partner..."**: To be a partner in the act of humiliation.
*   **"...in this shameful doom"**: "Shameful doom" refers to her fate after the rape, including the loss of her honor and reputation. "Doom" suggests this outcome is inevitable.

    *   **Overall meaning of line 7**: Tarquin wants to make Lucrece's shame complete by forcing her into a sexual relationship with a base person. This will ensure the shame never leaves her.

**Overall Meaning of Stanza 96:**

This stanza represents the climax of Tarquin's threats and the stark choice he offers Lucrece. He dismisses her pleas, demands that she yield to his lust, and threatens her with rape and subsequent humiliation if she refuses. The stanza reveals the depth of Tarquin's depravity and his desire not only to possess Lucrece physically but also to utterly destroy her honor and reputation. It foreshadows the tragic consequences that will follow.

**Literary Devices:**

*   **Metaphor:** The comparison of Lucrece's thoughts to "low vassals" is a key metaphor that reveals Tarquin's desire to control her internal state.
*   **Imagery:** The stanza is filled with vivid imagery, particularly the contrast between "love's coy touch" and the act of being "rudely tear[ed]". This creates a sense of both seduction and violent threat.
*   **Contrast:** The contrast between love and hate, tenderness and violence, purity and debasement is central to the stanza's power.
*   **Foreshadowing:** The mention of "shameful doom" foreshadows the tragic consequences of the rape and Lucrece's eventual suicide.
*   **Hyperbole:** The act of forcing her to sleep with a low-status servant is an exaggerated way to describe the "doom" that is set to occur after the rape.
*   **Alliteration**: The repetition of "b" in "base bed" creates an emphasis to the shame and degradation.

The stanza is a powerful example of Shakespeare's ability to use language to convey both the seductive lure of temptation and the horrific potential for violence and degradation. It highlights the complex themes of honor, lust, power, and shame that are central to the poem.
