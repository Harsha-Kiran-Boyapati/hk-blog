## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down Shakespeare's chilling description of Night from *The Rape of Lucrece*, stanza 110:

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"O comfort-killing Night, image of hell!"**
    *   **"O comfort-killing Night":** This line directly addresses Night with a sense of lamentation and dread. Night is personified as an active force that destroys comfort.
    *   **"image of hell":** Night is being compared to hell. It's a **metaphor** and it suggests an atmosphere of torment, sin, and despair.
    *   This entire line is an **apostrophe** because the narrator is directly addressing night, which is an inanimate concept.

*   **"Dim register and notary of shame!"**
    *   **"Dim register":** Refers to a poorly lit or unclear record. It implies that Night keeps track of shameful deeds, but does so in a hidden or obscured manner.
    *   **"and notary of shame!":** A notary is an official who witnesses and records important events. Night is like a notary, officially stamping shameful actions, validating them.
    *   The line uses **metaphor**, comparing Night to legal officials.

*   **"Black stage for tragedies and murders fell!"**
    *   **"Black stage":** Night is likened to a theater stage, but a black one. It suggests that dark and evil acts play out during the night.
    *   **"tragedies and murders fell!":** The kind of drama that is played out on this stage, these words imply tragedy and foul murders. The word "fell" reinforces the cruel and deadly nature of these acts.
    *   **Metaphor**: Night is being compared to a stage for the unfolding of terrible events.

*   **"Vast sin-concealing chaos! nurse of blame!"**
    *   **"Vast sin-concealing chaos!":** Night is described as a vast, chaotic place that hides sins. The word "chaos" suggests a lack of order and moral boundaries.
    *   **"nurse of blame!":** Night is seen as nurturing and fostering blame. The implication is that sin and misdeeds can grow out of the cover of the night.
    *   **Metaphor**: Night is the entity that hides sins and fosters blame.

*   **"Blind muffled bawd! dark harbour for defame!"**
    *   **"Blind muffled bawd!":** This is a particularly striking and repulsive image. A "bawd" is a madam or procurer, someone who arranges immoral sexual encounters. Night is described as "blind" (lacking moral sight) and "muffled" (silencing conscience or preventing discovery), suggesting a deliberate hiding and encouragement of sin.
    *   **"dark harbour for defame!":** Night is like a safe haven for slander and ruining of one's reputation. This suggests that the darkness protects and allows for the spread of malicious rumours.
    *   **Metaphor**: Night is being compared to a pimp and a harbour.

*   **"Grim cave of death! whispering conspirator"**
    *   **"Grim cave of death!":** Night is described as a fearsome, dark place of death. The word "grim" emphasizes the terror and coldness of death.
    *   **"whispering conspirator":** Night is personified as a conspirator who whispers secrets and plans evil deeds.
    *   **Metaphor**: Night is being compared to a death cave and a conspirator.

*   **"With close-tongued treason and the ravisher!"**
    *   **"With close-tongued treason":** Night is working with treason.
    *   **"and the ravisher!":** This is a direct link to the central event of the poem, the rape of Lucrece. The ravisher (Tarquin) is aided and abetted by the darkness.
    *   **Personification**: Treason has the quality of being "close-tongued," implying it is secretive and hidden.

**Overall Meaning of the Stanza:**

This stanza is a powerful condemnation of Night. It's not just a neutral time of day; it's an active force that enables and encourages evil. Shakespeare paints Night as a hellish, morally bankrupt entity that conspires with treachery and violence. It's a time when conscience is silenced, secrets are hidden, and the worst aspects of human nature are allowed to flourish. Night is not merely the *backdrop* for Lucrece's rape; it is an *accomplice*, an active participant in the tragic crime. The language is highly figurative, using metaphors and personification to create a vivid and disturbing portrait of Night as the incubator of sin and despair. The stanza creates a strong sense of foreboding and sets the stage for the violence to come.
