# Stanza 265 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
When they had sworn to this advised doom,
They did conclude to bear dead Lucrece thence,
To show her bleeding body thorough Rome,
And so to publish Tarquin‚Äôs foul offence;
Which being done with speedy diligence,
The Romans plausibly did give consent
To Tarquin‚Äôs everlasting banishment.

    *   "To show her bleeding body": Their purpose was to display her corpse that was still bleeding.
    *   "thorough Rome": Throughout Rome. (Note the archaic spelling of "through.")
*   **"And so to publish Tarquin‚Äôs foul offence;"**

**Literary Devices:**

*   **Alliteration:** "speedy diligence" - the repetition of the "s" sound.
*   **Irony:** The irony lies in the fact that the initial act of violence (Tarquin's rape) leads to a chain of events, including the suicide, that result in a positive outcome (the banishment of the tyrant) for Rome.
*   **Figurative Language**: The stanza's effectiveness comes in its ability to represent the action of the poem, the events of the rape of Lucrece and its aftermath, which sets the scene for the exile of Tarquin, and the end of the Roman monarchy.

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza describes the immediate aftermath of Lucrece's suicide and the plan her family and friends devise to avenge her. They decide to:

1.  Carry Lucrece's body through Rome.
2.  Publicly display her wounds to reveal Tarquin's crime.

Their actions, presented with speed and efficiency, ultimately led to the Romans agreeing to banish Tarquin. This stanza is a turning point, setting the stage for the end of Tarquin's reign and the eventual establishment of the Roman Republic. It encapsulates the plan, its execution, and the resulting consequence: the removal of the tyrant.
