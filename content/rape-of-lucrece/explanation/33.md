# Stanza 33 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
'O, what excuse can my invention make,
When thou shalt charge me with so black a deed?
Will not my tongue be mute, my frail joints shake,
Mine eyes forego their light, my false heart bleed?
The guilt being great, the fear doth still exceed;
And extreme fear can neither fight nor fly,
But coward-like with trembling terror die.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
This stanza from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* depicts Tarquin's internal struggle and overwhelming guilt after raping Lucrece. Let's break down each part:

* **"O, what excuse can my invention make,"** This line opens with an exclamation of despair.  "Invention" here doesn't mean creativity, but rather, the ability to devise a plan or excuse. Tarquin is desperately searching for a way to justify his actions, acknowledging his need for a fabricated defense.  The use of "O" is an apostrophe, a direct address to himself, reflecting his inner turmoil.

* **"When thou shalt charge me with so black a deed?"** This line reveals the anticipated accusation. "Thou" refers to Lucrece herself, or possibly his own conscience acting as an accuser.  "So black a deed" is a powerful metaphor highlighting the gravity of the rape, using the color black to symbolize evil and moral darkness.

* **"Will not my tongue be mute, my frail joints shake,"**  This line anticipates his physical reaction to the accusation. He foresees his inability to speak ("mute"), his body betraying him through trembling ("frail joints shake").  This is pathetic fallacy, where the physical state reflects the inner emotional state.

* **"Mine eyes forego their light, my false heart bleed?"** This continues the depiction of his physical response, his eyes losing their light suggesting shame and despair. "My false heart bleed" is a powerful image; hearts don't literally bleed, but this metaphor represents the inner pain and remorse, highlighting the hypocrisy ("false") of his actions.  The use of "bleed" evokes a visceral reaction, enhancing the emotional impact.

* **"The guilt being great, the fear doth still exceed; "** This line establishes a direct relationship between the magnitude of his guilt and the intensity of his fear.  The guilt is the cause, the fear is the effect.  Note the use of elevated language ("doth still exceed") reflecting the seriousness of the situation.

* **"And extreme fear can neither fight nor fly,"** This line presents a powerful paradox.  Fear usually prompts either confrontation ("fight") or escape ("fly"). But Tarquin's fear is so overwhelming, it paralyzes him, rendering him completely helpless.

* **"But coward-like with trembling terror die."** This final line concludes the stanza with a powerful metaphor. Fear has become a form of death ‚Äì a figurative death, representing his moral demise and the end of his self-respect.  The simile "coward-like" underscores his moral weakness and lack of courage to face the consequences of his actions.

**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza portrays Tarquin's paralyzing fear and guilt following the rape. He anticipates Lucrece's accusation and his own inability to defend himself, not only because he has no legitimate defense, but because his overwhelming guilt has rendered him physically and mentally incapacitated. He isn't simply afraid of punishment; he is experiencing a profound moral breakdown, a spiritual death brought about by his own actions. The imagery of physical manifestations of guilt‚Äîshaking limbs, dimming sight, a bleeding heart‚Äîemphasizes the internal torment he suffers.  The stanza highlights the devastating psychological consequences of his crime, foreshadowing his eventual downfall.
