# Stanza 88 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
'This deed will make thee only loved for fear;
But happy monarchs still are fear'd for love:
With foul offenders thou perforce must bear,
When they in thee the like offences prove:
If but for fear of this, thy will remove;
For princes are the glass, the school, the book,
Where subjects' eyes do learn, do read, do look.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"This deed will make thee only loved for fear;"**
    *   **Meaning:**  The speaker (Lucrece, or the narrator on her behalf) is addressing Tarquin (the rapist). This line means that Tarquin's action (the rape) will ensure he is only loved out of fear, not genuine affection or respect.  His power will be maintained only through intimidation.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Possible foreshadowing of his demise to follow.

*   **"But happy monarchs still are fear'd for love:"**
    *   **Meaning:**  In contrast to Tarquin, truly successful and "happy" rulers are feared *because* they are loved. Their power stems from the respect and devotion of their subjects, not simply from the threat of violence.  This is the ideal, a virtuous cycle of affection and authority.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Juxtaposition/Contrast:  Emphasizes the difference between Tarquin's corrupt rule and the ideal of good kingship.  Implied value judgment in the word "happy," suggesting true happiness for a ruler comes from legitimate power.

*   **"With foul offenders thou perforce must bear,"**
    *   **Meaning:**  Because Tarquin is a "foul offender" himself (having committed such a heinous act), he will be forced to tolerate similar offenses in others. He will be unable to justly punish wrongdoing because he lacks moral authority. He will become a victim of his own standard.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Foreshadowing, irony.

*   **"When they in thee the like offences prove:"**
    *   **Meaning:**  This line expands on the previous one, stating that others will commit similar offenses against him (or his rule), reflecting his own actions. "Prove" here means demonstrate or experience.  They will mirror his corruption.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Irony, connection to the principle of karma or reaping what you sow.

*   **"If but for fear of this, thy will remove;"**
    *   **Meaning:**  Lucrece, or the narrator, urges Tarquin to stop pursuing his desires ("thy will remove") even if only out of fear of the consequences outlined in the previous lines.  She appeals to his self-preservation, suggesting that even if he lacks a moral compass, he should at least be concerned about the practical outcome of his actions.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Alliteration ("will remove"), persuasive rhetoric.

*   **"For princes are the glass, the school, the book,"**
    *   **Meaning:**  This is a powerful metaphor explaining the role of rulers in society.  Princes (or leaders) act as mirrors reflecting behavior, schools from which subjects learn, and books from which they read morals and principles.  Their actions set the example for the entire kingdom.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Metaphor (extended).  Tricolon (three related things listed in parallel).

*   **"Where subjects' eyes do learn, do read, do look."**
    *   **Meaning:**  This reinforces the previous line. The subjects of a ruler closely observe their leader and base their own actions and values upon what they see.  This emphasizes the responsibility a ruler has to act justly and morally.
    *   **Literary Devices:** Repetition ("do"), implied personification of subjects' eyes learning and reading. Tricolon. Reinforces and amplifies the metaphor of the prince/ruler being a source of education and example.

**Overall Meaning of the Stanza:**

This stanza argues that Tarquin's act of rape has damaged his ability to rule effectively and justly.  By succumbing to his lust, he has forfeited the right to command respect and obedience based on anything other than fear. He will be unable to punish similar offenses in others because he himself is guilty.  The stanza also articulates the idea that leaders are role models.  Their actions are scrutinized by their subjects, who will emulate their behavior.  If Tarquin continues on this path, he will corrupt the entire kingdom. The stanza urges him to reconsider his course, not out of morality, but out of self-preservation and a recognition of the social consequences of his actions. It serves as a warning and a profound statement about the responsibilities of leadership. The stanza highlights the interconnectedness of private actions and public consequences, emphasizing the moral duty of those in power.
