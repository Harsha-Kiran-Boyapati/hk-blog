'To show the beldam daughters of her daughter,
To make the child a man, the man a child,
To slay the tiger that doth live by slaughter,

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down this stanza from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* line by line, identify the literary devices, and then summarize the overall meaning:

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"To show the beldam daughters of her daughter,"**
    *   *Beldam* means an old, ugly, or evil woman (akin to a hag).  This line suggests showing future generations of women (descendants of Lucrece's daughter) the truth or consequences of what has happened. It implies a warning or lesson to be learned from Lucrece's tragedy.
    *   **Alliteration:** "Daughters of her daughter" uses similar sounds for emphasis.

*   **"To make the child a man, the man a child,"**
    *   This is a statement about the power of the event to alter perceptions and roles. It suggests that the innocence of childhood ("child") can be lost prematurely, forcing someone to grow up quickly ("man"). Conversely, powerful or mature figures ("man") might be humbled or reduced to a state of helplessness ("child") by the consequences of the crime.
    *   **Antithesis:** This line presents direct opposites (child/man) for contrast and dramatic effect.

*   **"To slay the tiger that doth live by slaughter,"**
    *   The "tiger" symbolizes brutality, savagery, and predatory violence. "Slaughter" reinforces the violent nature. This line calls for the destruction of the force that perpetuates harm. In the context of the poem, it refers to Tarquin and the lust that motivated his actions.
    *   **Metaphor:** The tiger is a metaphor for Tarquin's rapacious desire.
    *   **Personification:** The tiger "lives by slaughter," giving it a human-like attribute.

*   **"To tame the unicorn and lion wild,"**
    *   The "unicorn and lion" are creatures known for their untamable natures, representing chaos or destructive potential. "Unicorn" is also associated with purity. The call to "tame" them suggests bringing order and justice to what is currently uncontrollable.
    *   **Metaphor:** Like the tiger, the unicorn and lion represent the wild, uncontrolled forces within human nature and society.
    *   **Alliteration:** Lion wild" uses similar sounds for emphasis.

*   **"To mock the subtle in themselves beguiled,"**
    *   "Subtle" refers to those who are clever, cunning, or deceitful. "Beguiled" means deceived. This line suggests that even those who pride themselves on their intelligence or cunning can be tricked or misled. The tragedy will expose and humiliate them.
    *   **Irony:** There's an irony in mocking the "subtle" who are "beguiled," as it implies that their cleverness ultimately failed them.

*   **"To cheer the ploughman with increaseful crops,"**
    *   The "ploughman" symbolizes the common, hard-working person or the land itself. "Increaseful crops" represents prosperity and abundance. This line suggests that the resolution of the tragedy will bring about a renewed sense of hope and productivity to the land and its people. Justice will lead to renewed fertility and prosperity.
    *   **Symbolism:** The ploughman represents the common people or the land.

*   **"And waste huge stones with little water drops."**
    *   This line is a proverb about the power of persistence. "Huge stones" represent formidable obstacles or deeply ingrained problems. "Little water drops" represent small, consistent efforts. It conveys the idea that even seemingly insignificant actions, when repeated over time, can overcome great challenges.
    *   **Metaphor:** The "huge stones" are a metaphor for the deep wrongs and ingrained injustices of the world.
    *   **Proverbial expression:** This line functions as a well-known proverb, lending it weight and authority.

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza is a complex summary of the potential consequences and outcomes of Lucrece's tragedy. It speaks to the power of the event to:

*   Instruct future generations about the dangers of lust and tyranny.
*   Transform individuals and societal structures.
*   Bring about justice by overcoming destructive forces.
*   Expose the limitations of cunning and deceit.
*   Restore prosperity and hope to the land and its people.
*   Highlight the power of persistent effort in achieving justice and change.

In essence, the stanza is not just about the immediate aftermath of the rape of Lucrece but about the potential for this tragedy to spark a wider societal transformation and create a better future. The repeated "To..." creates a sense of purpose and a call to action, implying that Lucrece's sacrifice should lead to positive change. It suggests that Lucrece's death will be a catalyst for significant change, leading to a world where virtue is valued, justice prevails, and societal ills are addressed.
