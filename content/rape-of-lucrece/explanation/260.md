## Original Stanza
```
But now he throws that shallow habit by,
Wherein deep policy did him disguise,
And armed his long-hid wits advisedly,
To check the tears in Collatinus‚Äô eyes.
‚ÄúThou wronged lord of Rome,‚Äù quoth he, ‚Äúarise!
Let my unsounded self, supposed a fool,
Now set thy long-experienced wit to school.
