Perchance his boast of Lucrece' sovereignty
Suggested this proud issue of a king;
For by our ears our hearts oft tainted be:
Perchance that envy of so rich a thing,
Braving compare, disdainfully did sting
His high-pitch'd thoughts, that meaner men should vaunt
That golden hap which their superiors want.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
This stanza from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* explores the possible motivations behind Tarquin's rape of Lucrece. Let's break it down line by line:

* **Line 1: "Perchance his boast of Lucrece' sovereignty"**:  This introduces the possibility (hence "perchance") that Tarquin's pride stemmed from Lucrece's renowned virtue and status ("sovereignty" here implies supreme excellence, not just political power).  This is a **hypothetical statement**, setting up the exploration of possible motives.

* **Line 2: "Suggested this proud issue of a king"**:  This connects Lucrece's exceptional virtue to Tarquin's royal pride.  The "proud issue" is the rape itself, presented as a consequence of Tarquin's inflated ego ("issue" has double meaning ‚Äì outcome and offspring, hinting at the potential for illegitimate children).

* **Line 3: "For by our ears our hearts oft tainted be"**: This is a general statement about the corrupting influence of flattery and boasting.  It acts as a transition, connecting Tarquin's hearing about Lucrece's excellence to the possibility of his corruption.  The use of "tainted" suggests a subtle poisoning of his mind.

* **Line 4: "Perchance that envy of so rich a thing"**:  This introduces another potential motive: envy.  Lucrece's virtue ("so rich a thing") is so exceptional that it provokes envy in Tarquin.

* **Line 5: "Braving compare, disdainfully did sting"**: This line describes the nature of this envy. Lucrece's virtues are presented as "braving compare," meaning they challenge any comparison, highlighting her superiority. This defiance ("disdainfully") stings Tarquin's pride.

* **Line 6: "His high-pitch'd thoughts, that meaner men should vaunt"**:  This explains the effect of the envy. Tarquin's "high-pitched thoughts" (his arrogant ambitions) are wounded by the idea that "meaner men" (those less noble than himself) might boast of possessing such happiness and virtue ("vaunt").

* **Line 7: "That golden hap which their superiors want"**:  This concludes the argument. The "golden hap" refers to Lucrece's virtue and happiness, which Tarquin envies because he, a superior in social standing, lacks it. This creates a sense of injustice and resentment in him.

**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza explores the psychology of Tarquin's actions, suggesting that his rape of Lucrece wasn't merely lustful but deeply rooted in pride and envy.  It proposes that hearing of Lucrece's exceptional virtue, rather than diminishing his pride, instead provoked a dangerous reaction: either a desire to possess what he perceived as rightfully his (as a king) or an envious rage at someone of lower status possessing something he lacked. This uses the concept of envy to justify his actions.

**Literary Devices:**

* **Hypothetical statements ("Perchance"):**  The repeated use of "perchance" creates ambiguity, allowing Shakespeare to explore multiple potential motives without definitively committing to one.
* **Metaphor:**  "Tainted be" is a metaphor suggesting a moral corruption.  "Golden hap" is a metaphor for Lucrece's virtue and happiness.
* **Personification:** Envy is personified as actively "stinging" Tarquin's thoughts.
* **Antithesis:** The contrast between Tarquin's high status and his envy of Lucrece's virtue creates a powerful dramatic irony.


The stanza masterfully blends psychological insight with poetic language, prompting the reader to consider the complex nature of Tarquin's motivations and the devastating consequences of pride and envy.
