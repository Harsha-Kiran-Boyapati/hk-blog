# Stanza 245 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
With this, they all at once began to say,
Her body‚Äôs stain her mind untainted clears,
While with a joyless smile she turns away
The face, that map which deep impression bears
Of hard misfortune, carved in it with tears.
‚ÄúNo, no,‚Äù quoth she, ‚Äúno dame, hereafter living
By my excuse shall claim excuse‚Äôs giving.‚Äù
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Let's break down Shakespeare's stanza 245 from *The Rape of Lucrece*:

**Line-by-line breakdown:**

* **"With this, they all at once began to say,"** This line sets the scene.  "With this" refers to some preceding event (Lucrece's declaration of her rape). A group of people, likely her family and friends, attempt to console her.  The word "all at once" emphasizes their simultaneous, perhaps slightly overwhelming, attempt at comfort.

* **"Her body‚Äôs stain her mind untainted clears,"** This is a crucial line, demonstrating a complex moral dilemma present in the poem.  "Body's stain" refers to the physical violation she suffered.  "Mind untainted clears" suggests that her virtue and moral integrity remain unsullied despite the physical assault. This is a common sentiment of the time, differentiating between bodily defilement and moral corruption.  This is a **paradox** - how can a physical act *not* stain the mind?  It shows the limitations of the societal understanding of rape and female virtue.

* **"While with a joyless smile she turns away"** Lucrece's reaction is described.  The "joyless smile" is an oxymoron, highlighting the forced nature of her response.  She's trying to appear composed, but her inner turmoil is evident. The act of turning away shows her rejection of their attempts at comfort.

* **"The face, that map which deep impression bears"**  This line employs a **metaphor**.  Lucrece's face is compared to a "map" that bears the "deep impression" of her suffering.  The "map" metaphor suggests the lasting, visible scars of her trauma.  The choice of "map" emphasizes the profound and indelible nature of her emotional and psychological wounds.

* **"Of hard misfortune, carved in it with tears."** This continues the "map" metaphor. The "hard misfortune" is the rape, and the "tears" are the agents that have etched the suffering onto her face. The verb "carved" emphasizes the permanence and severity of her trauma.

* **‚ÄúNo, no,‚Äù quoth she, ‚Äúno dame, hereafter living‚Äù** Lucrece emphatically rejects the attempted consolation.  "Quoth she" is an archaic phrasing meaning "she said". She declares that no other woman should use her experience as an excuse for similar behavior.

* **‚ÄúBy my excuse shall claim excuse‚Äôs giving.‚Äù** This is the climax of the stanza.  Lucrece refuses to let her experience justify the actions of others.  She will not offer an excuse for future victims, nor will she accept an excuse for her own violation.  It shows her strength of character and unwillingness to let the act define her or excuse others.  This is a very important idea, foreshadowing her suicide: she won't allow others to justify their crimes with her example.

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza depicts Lucrece's resolute refusal to accept the societal comfort offered to her.  While others attempt to minimize her trauma by separating her physical violation from her moral character, Lucrece recognizes the profound and lasting impact of the rape.  The stanza highlights the limitations of the patriarchal worldview of the time while showcasing Lucrece's strength, integrity, and determination to avoid setting a precedent that would excuse future acts of violence against women.  The literary devices used underscore the depth of her suffering and the complexity of her response, making it a pivotal moment in the narrative.
