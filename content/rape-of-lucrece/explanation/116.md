# Stanza 116 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
'Make me not object to the tell-tale Day!
The light will show, character'd in my brow,
The story of sweet chastity's decay,
The impious breach of holy wedlock vow:
Yea the illiterate, that know not how
To cipher what is writ in learned books,
Will quote my loathsome trespass in my looks.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"Make me not object to the tell-tale Day!"**
    *   **Meaning:** Lucrece is begging (presumably Tarquin, though the stanza itself doesn't specify) not to be revealed to the light of day.  "Tell-tale Day" is a personification. She fears exposure, the revealing of her shame. "Object" here means 'subject' or 'exposed'.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Personification:** Giving human qualities to "Day."
        *   **Apostrophe:** Addressing something (the Day) that cannot respond.
        *   **Imperative Mood:** The line is a direct command, highlighting her desperation.

*   **"The light will show, character'd in my brow,"**
    *   **Meaning:** She believes that the daylight will reveal the truth of what has happened written upon her face. "Character'd" means 'inscribed' or 'written'.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Metaphor:** Comparing her face to a written record. The "characters" (letters) of guilt will be visible.

*   **"The story of sweet chastity's decay,"**
    *   **Meaning:** The light will betray the loss of her precious virginity and honor. "Decay" suggests corruption and ruin.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Euphemism:** "Decay" is a softer way of saying 'destruction' or 'loss', but still powerful.
        *   **Alliteration:** of the "s" sound in "story of sweet."

*   **"The impious breach of holy wedlock vow:"**
    *   **Meaning:** It will reveal the sacrilegious violation of her marriage vows. "Impious" means lacking reverence or respect. "Breach" emphasizes the breaking of the vow.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Imagery:** Evokes the sanctity and importance of marriage vows.
        *   **Alliteration:** of the "h" sound in "holy wedlock"

    *   **Meaning:** Even the uneducated, those who cannot read written words,
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Hyperbole/Exaggeration:** Highlighting the idea that even those who cannot read books will be able to "read" her face.

*   **"To cipher what is writ in learned books,"**
    *   **Meaning:** who cannot decipher the meaning of complex texts
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Allusion:** This line is a subtle allusion to the idea that Lucrece's face will tell a story more potent and universal than any book.

*   **"Will quote my loathsome trespass in my looks."**
    *   **Meaning:** will be able to clearly see and denounce her shameful sin. "Quote" here doesn't mean recite verbatim, but rather 'interpret' or 'understand'. "Trespass" emphasizes that she has crossed a forbidden boundary.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Imagery:** Powerful image of her shame being visible and being judged by everyone.

**Overall Meaning of the Stanza:**

In this stanza, Lucrece is desperately pleading to remain hidden from public view. She believes her rape has indelibly marked her, so that the shame will be etched upon her face for all to see. Even those who are uneducated and cannot read will be able to perceive her ruined honor through her appearance. She fears the public humiliation and condemnation that will inevitably follow the revelation of the crime. This stanza effectively communicates the profound sense of guilt, shame, and defilement Lucrece feels after the rape, and her dread of exposure. It demonstrates that her honor, once pure and spotless, is now perceived as tarnished beyond repair. She sees herself as a walking testament to the destruction of her virtue.
