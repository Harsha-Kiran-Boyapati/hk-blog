# Stanza 255 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
The deep vexation of his inward soul
Hath served a dumb arrest upon his tongue;
Who, mad that sorrow should his use control
Or keep him from heart-easing words so long,
Begins to talk; but through his lips do throng
Weak words, so thick come in his poor heart‚Äôs aid
That no man could distinguish what he said.
```

**Overall Meaning of the Stanza:**

This stanza portrays Tarquin's emotional turmoil and the physical manifestations of his guilt and distress after raping Lucrece. The deep shame and regret he experiences are so overwhelming that they physically impede his ability to speak clearly. The stanza emphasizes the immense pressure he is under, the struggle to express his feelings, and the resulting failure to communicate effectively. It highlights the power of emotional intensity to both paralyze and distort one's ability to communicate. The jumbled and incoherent words symbolize the chaos and confusion within Tarquin's heart.

In the context of the poem, this stanza foreshadows Tarquin's downfall and the eventual consequences of his actions. The inability to articulate his feelings and the ensuing incoherence represent his inability to contain his inner conflict and the inevitable unraveling of his control.
