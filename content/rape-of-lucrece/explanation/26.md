# Stanza 26 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
His falchion on a flint he softly smiteth,
That from the cold stone sparks of fire do fly;
Whereat a waxen torch forthwith he lighteth,
Which must be lode-star to his lustful eye;
And to the flame thus speaks advisedly,
'As from this cold flint I enforced this fire,
So Lucrece must I force to my desire.'
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
This stanza from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* depicts Tarquin's preparation for the rape, using the act of striking a flint to create a fire as a metaphor for his intended violation of Lucrece. Let's break down each line:

* **"His falchion on a flint he softly smiteth,"**  This line sets the scene.  "Falchion" is a type of sword. Tarquin strikes his sword, not directly to ignite anything, but to strike the flint. The word "softly" is intriguing; it suggests a calculated, controlled violence, foreshadowing the deceptive nature of his actions. This is a **foreshadowing** device.

* **"That from the cold stone sparks of fire do fly,"** This line describes the result of the strike ‚Äì sparks emerging from the cold flint. This is a visually powerful image, showing the creation of something hot and vibrant from a cold, inert material.  It is an example of **imagery** and sets up the metaphor.

* **"Whereat a waxen torch forthwith he lighteth,"**  Tarquin uses the sparks to light a waxen torch. This highlights the deliberate nature of his actions; he's not just acting impulsively, but methodically preparing for his crime. The ‚Äúforthwith‚Äù emphasizes the swiftness of his actions, although "softly" previously indicated deliberateness. This shows a conflict, highlighting the conflict within Tarquin himself.  It is a significant **contradiction**.

* **"Which must be lode-star to his lustful eye;"** The torch becomes a guiding light ("lode-star," meaning a guiding star or Polaris) for his lustful gaze. This is powerful **metaphor**, comparing the torch to his lust, which will guide his actions toward Lucrece.  ‚ÄúLustful eye‚Äù is **personification**, giving the eye a human quality.

* **"And to the flame thus speaks advisedly,"**  Tarquin speaks to the flame. This is a sign of his deliberation and perhaps a hint of self-awareness of his wrongdoing.  "Advisedly" suggests a conscious, planned decision.  This indicates Tarquin is actively making the choice to rape.

* **"'As from this cold flint I enforced this fire,'** This is the crux of the metaphor.  Tarquin explicitly links the forcing of fire from the flint to his intention to force Lucrece.  "Enforced" highlights the violence inherent in both actions. This is a key example of **metaphor** and **simile** (a comparison using "as").

* **'So Lucrece must I force to my desire.'"** This line completes the metaphor, drawing a direct parallel between the violent extraction of fire and the violent act of rape he intends to commit upon Lucrece.

**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza uses the striking of flint to create fire as a powerful metaphor for Tarquin's planned rape of Lucrece.  The careful preparation, the deliberate lighting of the torch, and the explicit comparison reveal Tarquin's calculated, cold, and violent intentions.  The metaphor emphasizes the forceful, non-consensual nature of his act, highlighting the lack of respect and the inherently destructive nature of his desire. It also displays Tarquin's self-awareness of the violence he plans to perpetrate. The stanza foreshadows the rape and sets a dark and ominous tone for the events to come.
