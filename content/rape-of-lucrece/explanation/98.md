# Stanza 98 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
For with the nightly linen that she wears
He pens her piteous clamours in her head;
Cooling his hot face in the chastest tears
That ever modest eyes with sorrow shed.
O, that prone lust should stain so pure a bed!
The spots whereof could weeping purify,
Her tears should drop on them perpetually.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down stanza 98 of "The Rape of Lucrece" line by line and then synthesize the overall meaning.

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **Line 1: "For with the nightly linen that she wears"**

    *   **Meaning:** This line introduces a physical detail that underscores the violation.  "Nightly linen" refers to Lucrece's nightgown or bedclothes. The "with" implies that he uses the clothing as a means of oppression. He is using a symbol of her vulnerability and purity (being in bed, asleep) as a tool against her.
    *   **Literary Devices:**  *Synecdoche* or *Metonymy*: The "nightly linen" represents Lucrece herself, or her vulnerability.

*   **Line 2: "He pens her piteous clamours in her head;"**

    *   **Meaning:** This is a figurative line describing how Tarquin stifles Lucrece's cries and protests, not literally, but psychologically.  "Pens" means to enclose or confine. Her cries of pain and distress are trapped in her mind, unable to escape and perhaps intensifying her internal torment.
    *   **Literary Devices:**  *Metaphor*: "Pens" is a metaphor for the overwhelming force that prevents her from expressing her pain. *Alliteration:* the repetition of the P sound in "pens" and "piteous" emphasizes the line.

*   **Line 3: "Cooling his hot face in the chastest tears"**

    *   **Meaning:**  This is a stark image of Tarquin's cold and callous behavior.  He is unmoved by Lucrece's suffering and is literally "cooling" his flushed, lustful face with her tears, which are described as "chastest," meaning pure and innocent. This emphasizes the contrast between Tarquin's hot, lustful actions and Lucrece's pure innocence.
    *   **Literary Devices:**  *Juxtaposition/Contrast*: The "hot face" of lust contrasted with "chastest tears" highlights the profound difference between Tarquin's motives and Lucrece's innocence. *Hyperbole*: Exaggeration in the use of "chastest tears"

*   **Line 4: "That ever modest eyes with sorrow shed."**

    *   **Meaning:**  This line emphasizes the unparalleled purity and innocence of Lucrece. It reinforces the idea that these are the purest tears of sorrow ever shed by a woman of such modesty and virtue. It's a compliment, but one born out of a horrible situation.
    *   **Literary Devices:**  *Hyperbole*: Similar to the previous line, exaggerating the purity of the tears.

*   **Line 5: "O, that prone lust should stain so pure a bed!"**

    *   **Meaning:** This is an exclamation expressing grief and outrage at the act of rape. "Prone lust" refers to lust that is inclined (prone) towards evil and wickedness. "Pure a bed" refers both to the literal bed (a symbol of the marriage bed and domestic sanctity) and to Lucrece herself (her purity). The word "stain" evokes a sense of lasting damage. The line is a lament over the defilement of something so sacred.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Exclamation*: The "O" marks this as an expression of strong emotion.  *Metaphor*: "Stain" is a metaphor for the corruption and dishonor that Tarquin has inflicted. *Alliteration*: repetition of the P sound in "prone" and "pure" to highlight this idea.

*   **Line 6: "The spots whereof could weeping purify,"**

    *   **Meaning:** This introduces the idea that perhaps the shame and pollution of the act could be washed away by tears. "Spots" refers to both physical stains (perhaps from the act of violence) and the metaphorical stain of dishonor.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Metaphor*: The "spots" are symbolic of the stain of dishonor.

*   **Line 7: "Her tears should drop on them perpetually."**

    *   **Meaning:** This line continues the idea that Lucrece's tears could (or should) endlessly fall on the "spots" to cleanse them. It suggests a desire for unending penance and atonement, even if it is ultimately futile. There is a sense of overwhelming guilt and the impossible desire to undo the wrong.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Hyperbole*: The idea of tears falling "perpetually" emphasizes the unending sorrow and guilt.

**Overall Meaning:**

Stanza 98 paints a vivid and disturbing picture of the rape of Lucrece. It focuses on the psychological torment she endures, the callousness of Tarquin, and the profound sense of defilement and loss of innocence. The stanza highlights the stark contrast between Tarquin's base lust and Lucrece's inherent purity, emphasizing the tragedy of the event. The use of powerful imagery and figurative language creates a sense of outrage and pity, foreshadowing Lucrece's ultimate despair and suicide. The stanza also begins to explore the idea of whether the stain of the rape can ever be cleansed, introducing a theme of guilt and the desire for expiation that will be central to the rest of the poem. The stanza showcases the immense violation that Lucrece has endured and sets a mournful and despondent tone for the rest of the narrative.
