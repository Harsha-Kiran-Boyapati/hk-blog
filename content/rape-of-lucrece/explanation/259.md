**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza marks a pivotal moment in the narrative. It describes Brutus's transformation from a seemingly foolish, harmless individual (who was underestimated by the other Romans) to someone who strategically uses the tragedy of Lucrece's death to his advantage. The stanza explains how Brutus was perceived - as a jester. However, he used the event as an opportunity to hide his true personality, while hiding his foolishness in the attention on Lucrece's tragedy, and revealing a more serious and dignified persona. He has calculatedly chosen this moment, the scene of grief and outrage, to shed his mask and make his intentions known. The stanza is a set-up for the rebellion to follow and lays the foundation for his eventual role in overthrowing the Tarquin monarchy. The poem emphasizes the depth of deception and planning behind Brutus's character.
