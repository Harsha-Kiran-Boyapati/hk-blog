# Stanza 11 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
Their silent war of lilies and of roses,
Which Tarquin view'd in her fair face's field,
In their pure ranks his traitor eye encloses;
Where, lest between them both it should be kill'd,
The coward captive vanquished doth yield
To those two armies that would let him go,
Rather than triumph in so false a foe.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
This stanza from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* describes the internal conflict Lucrece experiences as Tarquin observes her. Let's break it down line by line:

* **"Their silent war of lilies and of roses,"** This line uses the metaphor of a battle between lilies (typically representing purity and innocence) and roses (often symbolizing love and passion). These represent the conflicting emotions within Lucrece: her virtue (lilies) struggling against the burgeoning feelings stirred by Tarquin's presence (roses).  This is an example of **personification**, as the flowers are given human-like qualities of warfare.

* **"Which Tarquin view'd in her fair face's field,"** This line continues the military metaphor. Lucrece's face is described as a "field" ‚Äì the battlefield where this internal conflict plays out.  Tarquin is the observer, strategically watching this internal struggle. The use of "field" is a **metaphor** that visually encapsulates the internal war raging within Lucrece.

* **"In their pure ranks his traitor eye encloses;"** Tarquin's gaze ("his traitor eye") is described as "enclosing" the warring emotions. This imagery suggests he is actively observing and perhaps even influencing the internal struggle. The word "traitor" foreshadows his impending actions and labels him as an antagonist before any direct act of violence.

* **"Where, lest between them both it should be kill'd,"** This line refers to the "it" ‚Äì likely representing Lucrece's will or her sense of self. The concern is that if the conflict between purity and passion rages on unchecked, it will destroy her ("be kill'd"). This shows Lucrece‚Äôs internal struggle is a fight for her very being.

* **"The coward captive vanquished doth yield"**  Here, Lucrece's will ("the coward captive") is shown to be defeated.  She surrenders ("doth yield") not through active choice, but because her internal struggle has been lost.  The use of "coward" is significant. It doesn't describe Lucrece's actions but rather the fragility of her willpower against Tarquin's overwhelming presence.  This speaks to the vulnerability of her situation.

* **"To those two armies that would let him go,"** The surrender is to the "two armies" (lilies and roses), not to Tarquin directly.  This implies that Lucrece's virtue is not actively giving in to Tarquin's desire but is overwhelmed by the conflicting emotions he awakened. The suggestion that the opposing emotions would "let him go" (her will) implies the conflict was irresolvable for her, a point strengthened by the next line.

* **"Rather than triumph in so false a foe."** This line clarifies that Lucrece's surrender isn't a victory for Tarquin, but the avoidance of a worse outcome.  "So false a foe" refers to the destructive nature of passion, especially considering Tarquin's deceitful character. The internal conflict is resolved with the loss of her own control.  The "false foe" is both Tarquin and her own feelings.


**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza masterfully portrays Lucrece's internal struggle as Tarquin watches. Her virtue and potential passion are presented as warring forces, and Tarquin's presence acts as a catalyst to this conflict. Ultimately, her will is not actively overcome by Tarquin's strength, but rather crumbles under the weight of conflicting emotions, highlighting her vulnerability and foreshadowing the tragedy to come.  The stanza uses vivid military metaphors and personification to convey the intensity of this psychological battle.
