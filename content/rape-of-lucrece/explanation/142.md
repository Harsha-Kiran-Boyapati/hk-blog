# Stanza 142 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
'Let him have time to see his friends his foes,
And merry fools to mock at him resort;
Let him have time to mark how slow time goes
In time of sorrow, and how swift and short
His time of folly and his time of sport;
And ever let his unrecalling crime
Have time to wail th' abusing of his time.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down this stanza from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* line by line, identify the literary devices, and then discuss its overall meaning.

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"Let him have time to see his friends his foes,"**
    *   **Breakdown:**  This line implores that Tarquin should be given ample time to distinguish between true friends and enemies.
    *   **Literary Devices:**  *Alliteration* (repetition of the "f" sound in "friends" and "foes") emphasizes the contrast between the two groups.

*   **"And merry fools to mock at him resort;"**
    *   **Breakdown:** This line suggests that Tarquin should be subject to ridicule and derision from foolish, light-hearted people. "Resort" means they should come to him for this purpose.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Irony* (these 'fools' are wise enough to mock him)

*   **"Let him have time to mark how slow time goes"**
    *   **Breakdown:**  This introduces a key concept: Tarquin should experience the agonizing slowness of time when in sorrow.
    *   **Literary Devices:** None in particular. The line relies on the inherent understanding of how time feels when you are unhappy.

*   **"In time of sorrow, and how swift and short"**
    *   **Breakdown:**  This line directly contrasts the slow passage of time in sorrow with the rapid passage of time when indulging in pleasure or foolishness.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Juxtaposition/Contrast* (between "slow time" in sorrow and "swift and short" time in folly).

*   **"His time of folly and his time of sport;"**
    *   **Breakdown:** This amplifies that idea: Tarquin should have the chance to see how quickly his pleasurable moments vanished.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Parallelism* (using the same grammatical structure "His time of...") for emphasis. *Repetition* of "time"

*   **"And ever let his unrecalling crime"**
    *   **Breakdown:**  This means Tarquin's crime, which he cannot undo or take back, must always weigh on him. "Unrecalling" means irreversible.
    *   **Literary Devices:** None in particular

*   **"Have time to wail th' abusing of his time."**
    *   **Breakdown:** Finally, Tarquin should have all the time in the world to lament (wail) the way he misused his time and life through his actions.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Irony* (Time is a thing he has abused and yet now it is the cause of his punishment). *Alliteration* (the "t" sound in "time to" and "th") connects time to his punishment.

**Overall Meaning and Interpretation:**

The stanza is a powerful curse, or a desire for just retribution, levied against Tarquin (implied to be coming from a figure such as Lucrece's husband or father).  It's not simply a wish for his death, but a much more elaborate and psychologically torturous fate.  The idea is that Tarquin should live with the *consequences* of his actions, and those consequences should be drawn out and excruciating.

The stanza focuses heavily on the concept of *time*. The repetition of the word "time" emphasizes its importance. The desire is that he be forced to *feel* the weight of his crime.

*   He should realize the true nature of the people around him (friends vs. enemies).
*   He should be humiliated and mocked.
*   He should experience the slow agony of sorrow and regret, contrasting sharply with the fleeting pleasure he sought in his crime.
*   He should be forever haunted by the irreversible nature of his actions.
*   He should spend an eternity regretting his misuse of time and his life.

In essence, the stanza desires that Tarquin's life be a living hell, a constant reminder of his transgression. The emphasis on "time" suggests a prolonged period of suffering, a punishment far worse than a swift death. The stanza is a complex blend of justice, revenge, and moral condemnation. It is a wish that Tarquin live long enough to fully comprehend the gravity of his crime and to suffer the full consequences.
