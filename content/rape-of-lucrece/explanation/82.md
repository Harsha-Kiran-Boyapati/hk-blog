She conjures him by high almighty Jove,
By knighthood, gentry, and sweet friendship's oath,
By her untimely tears, her husband's love,

**Overall Meaning of Stanza 82:**

This stanza is a powerful and desperate plea from Lucrece to Tarquin, using a comprehensive range of appeals to try to dissuade him from raping her. She invokes divine authority, social conventions, moral obligations, personal relationships, and the fundamental principles of right and wrong. She hopes to trigger a sense of conscience and shame in Tarquin, urging him to reject his lustful desires and choose the path of honor instead. The sheer scope of her appeals highlights the magnitude of the crime Tarquin is about to commit and the moral crisis at the heart of the poem.  It is a desperate attempt to stop the inevitable by appealing to every possible virtue or sense of obligation Tarquin might possess. It tragically underscores the futility of her efforts.
