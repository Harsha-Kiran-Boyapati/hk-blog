# Stanza 4 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
O happiness enjoy'd but of a few!
And, if possess'd, as soon decay'd and done
As is the morning's silver-melting dew
Against the golden splendor of the sun!
An expired date, cancell'd ere well begun:
Honour and beauty, in the owner's arms,
Are weakly fortress'd from a world of harms.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
This stanza from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* explores the fleeting nature of happiness and the vulnerability of beauty and honor. Let's break it down line by line:

* **"O happiness enjoy'd but of a few!"** This line opens with an apostrophe ("O"), directly addressing happiness.  It highlights the exclusivity of true happiness, suggesting it's a rare and precious commodity experienced by only a select few.

* **"And, if possess'd, as soon decay'd and done"** This line introduces the central idea: even when happiness is achieved, it's incredibly transient. The word "decay'd" emphasizes the inevitable decline and loss.  The parallel structure ("decay'd and done") strengthens the sense of finality.

* **"As is the morning's silver-melting dew"**  This line uses a **simile** to illustrate the ephemeral nature of happiness, comparing it to morning dew that quickly disappears.  The imagery is beautiful and evocative, painting a picture of delicate beauty quickly vanishing. "Silver-melting" is particularly effective, suggesting a gradual dissipation.

* **"Against the golden splendor of the sun!"** This line completes the simile, explaining *why* the dew disappears.  The "golden splendor of the sun" represents a powerful force (time, change, fate) that overwhelms and destroys the delicate beauty of the dew.  The **juxtaposition** of "silver" and "golden" emphasizes the contrast between the fragile and the powerful.

* **"An expired date, cancell'd ere well begun:"** This line continues the metaphor, extending the idea to a "date" that expires before it's even properly begun. This is a **metaphor** for happiness, implying its brevity and preordained end.  "Cancell'd ere well begun" highlights the suddenness and abruptness of its termination.

* **"Honour and beauty, in the owner's arms,"**  This line shifts the focus from the general concept of happiness to the specific vulnerabilities of honor and beauty, particularly within the context of the poem‚Äôs impending rape.  The placement of "in the owner's arms" suggests a false sense of security.

* **"Are weakly fortress'd from a world of harms."** This final line concludes the stanza with a powerful statement.  "Weakly fortress'd" signifies the inadequate protection offered to honor and beauty, even within the supposed safety of the owner's embrace.  The "world of harms" emphasizes the pervasive dangers that threaten them.

**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza laments the fleeting nature of happiness, particularly focusing on the precariousness of honor and beauty.  Even when seemingly possessed, these precious qualities are vulnerable and easily destroyed by the inevitable forces of time and circumstance. The imagery of the dew melting in the sunlight serves as a potent symbol for this fragility, foreshadowing the tragic events that will befall Lucrece.  The stanza establishes a tone of melancholy and foreboding, setting the stage for the poem's central tragedy.
