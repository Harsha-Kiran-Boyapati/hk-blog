# Stanza 193 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
When, silly groom! God wot, it was defect
Of spirit, life, and bold audacity.
Such harmless creatures have a true respect
To talk in deeds, while others saucily
Promise more speed, but do it leisurely.
Even so this pattern of the worn-out age
Pawned honest looks, but laid no words to gage.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down Stanza 193 of Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* line by line, then look at the overall meaning and literary devices.

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"When, silly groom! God wot, it was defect"**
    *   **"When..."**: This sets up a contrast or realization that the speaker is about to make.
    *   **"silly groom!"**: "Silly" means foolish or innocent. "Groom" here is a general term for a man or young man, but in this context, it could be referring back to Collatine, Lucrece's husband, or more broadly, any man who trusts too easily. The speaker is scolding a naive or foolish man.
    *   **"God wot"**: An archaic phrase meaning "God knows" or "God understands." It adds a tone of certainty and perhaps a bit of rueful regret.
    *   **"it was defect"**: The main point here is that the foolishness stemmed from a flaw.
    *   *In this line, we see an **apostrophe** with the phrase "silly groom!" and some **archaic language** in the phrase "God wot."*

*   **"Of spirit, life, and bold audacity."**
    *   This line specifies *what* that "defect" consists of: a lack of spirit (courage, energy), life (vitality, awareness of danger), and bold audacity (shameless daring). In essence, a lack of the very qualities that Tarquin *does* possess and that allow him to commit the crime.
    *   *Here, we see an example of **triadic structure**, in the use of 'spirit, life, and bold audacity'. It is a list of three, which is a common feature in literature.*

*   **"Such harmless creatures have a true respect"**
    *   "Such harmless creatures": Refers back to the "silly groom" and men who lack the boldness to suspect evil.
    *   "have a true respect": They value honor and keeping their word. They believe in honest dealings.

*   **"To talk in deeds, while others saucily"**
    *   "To talk in deeds": Their actions speak louder than words. They are men of integrity who *do* what they say.
    *   "while others saucily": In contrast, other men (like Tarquin) act "saucily," meaning impudently, presumptuously, or with arrogance.

*   **"Promise more speed, but do it leisurely."**
    *   "Promise more speed": These deceitful men are quick to make promises but slow to deliver on them. Their words are empty.
    *   "but do it leisurely": The implication is that they don't intend to keep their promises at all; they drag their feet or never follow through. This highlights their insincerity and hypocrisy.

*   **"Even so this pattern of the worn-out age"**
    *   "Even so": Meaning "in the same way" or "similarly".
    *   "this pattern of the worn-out age": "Pattern" suggests a recurring type of person or behavior. "Worn-out age" refers to a corrupt or degenerate time. This phrase connects Tarquin's actions to a broader societal problem of moral decay.

*   **"Pawned honest looks, but laid no words to gage."**
    *   "Pawned honest looks": He presented a fa√ßade of honesty and trustworthiness ("honest looks" as collateral). This is deceptive; he only *seemed* virtuous.
    *   "but laid no words to gage": He didn't back up his appearance with a solid commitment to his word. To "lay...to gage" means to put something of value down as a pledge or guarantee. Tarquin didn't put his words to the test of sincerity. His word means nothing.
    *   *This line uses a **metaphor** comparing Tarquin's deception to a financial transaction.*

**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza contrasts the naive honesty of well-meaning men with the deceptive nature of men like Tarquin. The speaker laments the "silly groom" who is too trusting and lacks the "spirit, life, and bold audacity" to suspect or prevent evil. Men of integrity "talk in deeds," meaning their actions match their words. However, the stanza argues that the current age is corrupt, filled with men like Tarquin who "pawned honest looks" ‚Äì they present a false appearance of virtue but lack genuine commitment to their word. Tarquin is presented as a representative of a decadent society where appearances are valued over genuine morality and honour. This stanza sets the stage for understanding how Tarquin's deceitful facade enabled him to commit his heinous act.

**Literary Devices Summary:**

*   **Apostrophe:** "silly groom!"
*   **Archaic Language:** "God wot"
*   **Triadic Structure:** "spirit, life, and bold audacity"
*   **Metaphor:** "Pawned honest looks, but laid no words to gage"

The stanza is rich in imagery and rhetorical devices, all contributing to its overall message about the contrast between genuine virtue and deceptive appearances in a corrupt age.
