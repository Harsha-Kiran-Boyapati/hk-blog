# Stanza 161 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
'You mocking-birds,' quoth she, 'your tunes entomb
Within your hollow-swelling feather'd breasts,
And in my hearing be you mute and dumb:
My restless discord loves no stops nor rests;
A woeful hostess brooks not merry guests:
Relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears;
Distress likes dumps when time is kept with tears.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down this powerful stanza from *The Rape of Lucrece*.

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"You mocking-birds," quoth she, "your tunes entomb"**:
    *   **"You mocking-birds,"**: Lucrece is directly addressing the birds she hears singing, calling them "mocking-birds."  This is **apostrophe** (addressing someone or something that is not present or cannot respond). The term mockingbirds is symbolic of their carefree joyful life which contrast to her life of despair.
    *   **"quoth she,"**: This is an archaic way of saying "said she." It is a typical Shakespearean way of introducing a speaker.
    *   **"your tunes entomb"**:  This means she wants them to bury or hide their songs. The verb "entomb" is a strong word, suggesting death and burial, emphasizing the seriousness of her request. This is also **metaphorical**: she doesn't literally want them to bury their songs, but to stop singing.

*   **"Within your hollow-swelling feather'd breasts,"**:
    *   **"Within your hollow-swelling feather'd breasts,"**: This is a description of the birds. "Hollow-swelling" might refer to the resonating chambers within their bodies that allow them to sing loudly. "Feather'd breasts" is simply a descriptive phrase. Note the **alliteration** in "hollow-swelling." This line describes the physical form of the birds with a hint of negativity that she is projecting on them.

*   **"And in my hearing be you mute and dumb:"**:
    *   **"And in my hearing be you mute and dumb:"**: This is a direct command: she orders the birds to be silent. "Mute and dumb" is **tautology** (saying the same thing twice in different words) and it emphasizes her desire for complete silence. It's also an example of **repetition**, further highlighting her desperation.

*   **"My restless discord loves no stops nor rests;"**:
    *   **"My restless discord"**: This refers to Lucrece's inner turmoil and emotional pain. "Discord" suggests a lack of harmony or agreement, reflecting her internal conflict. This is a **metaphor**: her emotional state is being compared to discord.
    *   **"loves no stops nor rests"**:  She is saying that her pain is constant and unrelenting. It has no pauses ("stops") or moments of peace ("rests"). This line highlights the unending nature of her suffering. "Stops nor rests" are also musical terms, further connecting to the idea of harmony and discord.

*   **"A woeful hostess brooks not merry guests:"**:
    *   **"A woeful hostess"**: Lucrece casts herself as a hostess (someone who receives and entertains guests). "Woeful" emphasizes her sorrowful state.
    *   **"brooks not merry guests"**: "Brooks" means tolerates or allows. "Merry guests" represent happiness and joy. Therefore, a "woeful hostess" cannot tolerate "merry guests." This is an **analogy**: the relationship between a hostess and guests is being used to represent Lucrece's internal state. She, in her misery, cannot bear to be around anything happy.

*   **"Relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears;"**:
    *   **"Relish your nimble notes"**: "Relish" means to enjoy or appreciate. "Nimble notes" refers to the birds' quick and lively songs.
    *   **"to pleasing ears"**: She suggests that their music should be enjoyed by those who are receptive to it. It is a contrast to her own emotional state.

*   **"Distress likes dumps when time is kept with tears."**:
    *   **"Distress likes dumps"**: "Distress" refers to her suffering. "Dumps" are sad, mournful songs or laments. This means that her sorrow finds comfort in sorrowful music.
    *   **"when time is kept with tears"**: This implies that the appropriate accompaniment to her sorrowful songs is weeping. "Time is kept" again uses musical terminology, suggesting a rhythm and consistency to her grief.

**Overall Meaning and Literary Devices:**

This stanza is a powerful expression of Lucrece's grief and isolation. The main idea is that Lucrece, consumed by her suffering after the rape, cannot bear to be around anything that reminds her of joy or peace.

*   She silences the birds because their songs represent a joy she can no longer experience.
*   She acknowledges that her internal "discord" is constant and unrelenting.
*   She states that she, in her "woeful" state, cannot tolerate the presence of "merry guests," symbolizing happiness.
*   Finally, she reveals that she finds solace only in sorrow, symbolized by "dumps" (mournful songs) and the constant flow of "tears."

**Key Literary Devices:**

*   **Apostrophe:** Directly addressing the birds.
*   **Metaphor:**  Her emotional state is compared to "discord."
*   **Analogy:** Comparing her situation to that of a "woeful hostess" who can't tolerate "merry guests."
*   **Alliteration:** "hollow-swelling"
*   **Repetition/Tautology:** "mute and dumb"
*   **Imagery:**  "hollow-swelling feather'd breasts," "nimble notes," "time is kept with tears."
*   **Musical Imagery:**  "tunes," "notes," "discord," "stops," "rests," "time is kept."  This highlights the contrast between the harmony she used to know and the discord she now feels.

The stanza is a masterful depiction of despair, using vivid imagery and carefully chosen words to convey the depth of Lucrece's suffering and her complete rejection of anything that offers a glimmer of hope or happiness. The musical imagery is particularly effective in highlighting the contrast between her former life and her current state of profound sorrow.
