# Stanza 136 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
'To fill with worm-holes stately monuments,
To feed oblivion with decay of things,
To blot old books and alter their contents,
To pluck the quills from ancient ravens' wings,
To dry the old oak's sap and cherish springs,
To spoil antiquities of hammer'd steel,
And turn the giddy round of Fortune's wheel;
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down stanza 136 of Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* line by line, then look at the overall meaning and literary devices.

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"To fill with worm-holes stately monuments,"**

    *   **Breakdown:** This line describes the destructive power of time. "Worm-holes" symbolize decay and corruption. "Stately monuments" represent things meant to be permanent and impressive. The idea is that even the grandest structures are eventually eaten away by time and neglect.
    *   **Literary Device:** **Alliteration** with "worm-holes" and "stately" gives emphasis.

*   **"To feed oblivion with decay of things,"**

    *   **Breakdown:** "Oblivion" is personified as a hungry force, always consuming. "Decay of things" means the inevitable breakdown and destruction of all material objects and even concepts. Time gives the decay of things to oblivion to consume.
    *   **Literary Device:** **Personification** (oblivion feeding), **Metaphor** (oblivion as a force), and **Alliteration** with "feed" and "oblivion".

*   **"To blot old books and alter their contents,"**

    *   **Breakdown:** This line goes beyond physical destruction and speaks to the distortion of history and knowledge. Time can corrupt written records, changing their meanings or erasing them altogether.
    *   **Literary Device:** **Imagery** (blot old books) evokes a sense of destruction.

*   **"To pluck the quills from ancient ravens' wings,"**

    *   **Breakdown:** Ravens were often associated with wisdom, prophecy, and longevity. Plucking their quills (used for writing) implies silencing the voices of the past, or disabling the means of recording or transmitting knowledge.
    *   **Literary Device:** **Symbolism** (ravens represent wisdom/past), **Imagery** (violent action).

*   **"To dry the old oak's sap and cherish springs,"**

    *   **Breakdown:** This line presents a paradox. An "old oak" symbolizes strength and endurance, whose sap drying would mean eventual destruction. "Springs" represent youth, growth, and renewal, which are being cherished/watered in comparison. Time favors the new and allows the old to decay.
    *   **Literary Device:** **Contrast** (old oak vs. springs), **Symbolism** (oak representing enduring strength, springs representing new beginnings).

*   **"To spoil antiquities of hammer'd steel,"**

    *   **Breakdown:** Even strong objects made of "hammer'd steel" which would be considered durable, are not immune to time's destruction. "Antiquities" represent the achievements and artifacts of the past.
    *   **Literary Device:** **Imagery** (spoiled steel) is a very striking image, **Alliteration** with "spoil" and "steel".

*   **"And turn the giddy round of Fortune's wheel;"**

    *   **Breakdown:** This line connects the destructive nature of time to the unpredictable nature of fate. "Fortune's wheel" is a common symbol of the rise and fall of individuals and empires. Time, or fate, controls who rises and falls on this wheel. "Giddy" suggests the dizzying, disorienting effect of these changes.
    *   **Literary Device:** **Metaphor** (Fortune's wheel), **Alliteration** with "giddy round".

**Overall Meaning:**

Stanza 136 is a powerful meditation on the destructive and transformative power of time. It paints a bleak picture of how time erodes not only physical objects but also history, knowledge, and even the very fabric of fate. Everything is subject to decay, corruption, and eventual oblivion. Time favors the new and diminishes the old. The stanza emphasizes the fleeting nature of human achievement and the ultimate triumph of time and change. These are the actions of time itself.

**In the context of the poem:** This stanza helps to explain why Lucrece is so upset and takes the actions she does. The violation of her honor is not just a personal tragedy but also an act of destruction that mirrors the destructive forces of time itself. This stanza, among others, emphasizes that her rape represents an act of destruction that goes beyond her person.
