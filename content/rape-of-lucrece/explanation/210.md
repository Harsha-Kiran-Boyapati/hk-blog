# Stanza 210 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
‚ÄúPoor instrument,‚Äù quoth she, ‚Äúwithout a sound,
I‚Äôll tune thy woes with my lamenting tongue,
And drop sweet balm in Priam‚Äôs painted wound,
And rail on Pyrrhus that hath done him wrong,
And with my tears quench Troy that burns so long,
And with my knife scratch out the angry eyes
Of all the Greeks that are thine enemies.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down stanza 210 from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece*:

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"Poor instrument,‚Äù quoth she, ‚Äúwithout a sound,"**
    *   **"Poor instrument"**: This refers to the dagger that Lucrece is holding.  She sees it as a tool, but also pitiable because it's currently inert, *without a sound*. It hasn't yet served its purpose.
    *   **"quoth she"**:  Archaic way of saying "said she."
    *   **Meaning:** Lucrece is addressing the dagger, recognizing it as the means by which she will exact her revenge or find her release from shame.

*   **"I‚Äôll tune thy woes with my lamenting tongue,"**
    *   **"tune thy woes"**:  A **metaphor**. She will give voice to the dagger's (implied) suffering. The woes it carries represent the injustices and tragedies it is meant to resolve (i.e., her rape).
    *   **"lamenting tongue"**:  Her voice, filled with sorrow and complaint, will be the accompaniment to the dagger's silent mission.
    *   **Meaning:** She will express the pain and injustice surrounding her situation through her mournful words, acting as a conduit for the emotions associated with the act.

*   **"And drop sweet balm in Priam‚Äôs painted wound,"**
    *   **"sweet balm"**: Refers to something soothing.
    *   **"Priam's painted wound"**: An **allusion** to the Trojan War and the wounds of Priam, the king of Troy. "Painted" might suggest the wounds are metaphorical, representing the long-lasting trauma and grief of the Trojan War.  It also connects the painted scenes on tapestries with the wounds that the Trojans have suffered over a long period of time.
    *   **Meaning:** This is a metaphorical act of consolation. She will attempt to offer some relief, however small, to the lingering pain of past injustices, even those as ancient as the Trojan War. She will align herself with the victims of violence.

*   **"And rail on Pyrrhus that hath done him wrong,"**
    *   **"rail on Pyrrhus"**: She will vehemently denounce Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles, who brutally murdered Priam during the sack of Troy. "Rail" means to speak against angrily.
    *   **"that hath done him wrong"**: Emphasizes the injustice of Pyrrhus's actions.
    *   **Meaning:** She vows to condemn the perpetrators of violence and injustice, drawing a parallel between Pyrrhus's cruelty and the actions of her rapist, Tarquin.

*   **"And with my tears quench Troy that burns so long,"**
    *   **"quench Troy that burns so long"**: A **hyperbole** (exaggeration) and **metaphor**.  Her tears are so copious and potent that they could extinguish the flames of the (metaphorical) burning Troy.  Troy represents long-suffering and destruction.
    *   **Meaning:** She expresses the depth of her grief and sorrow, suggesting it's powerful enough to undo even the most devastating historical events. This is hyperbolic; her sorrow is vast.

*   **"And with my knife scratch out the angry eyes"**
    *   **"scratch out the angry eyes"**: A violent image.
    *   **"angry eyes"**: Represents the vengeful gaze of the Greeks, particularly those who caused the fall of Troy. Metaphorically, it suggests the judging and accusatory gaze of society.
    *   **Meaning:** She will symbolically blind the sources of hostility and judgment, seeking to nullify the power of those who would condemn her or perpetuate violence. She is turning the violence back on the original aggressors.

*   **"Of all the Greeks that are thine enemies."**
    *   **"thine enemies"**: Refers to the dagger's enemies, which are implicitly those who have caused suffering and injustice. It also connects to all the injustice from The Rape.
    *   **Meaning:** Reinforces the idea that the dagger is a weapon against all forms of oppression and wrongdoing.

**Overall Meaning:**

In this stanza, Lucrece, holding the dagger, embarks on a powerful speech. She connects her personal tragedy to larger historical injustices, particularly the fall of Troy. She promises to use her voice to lament, condemn, and offer solace, drawing parallels between her own situation and the suffering of others. The dagger becomes a symbol of her resolve to fight back against violence and oppression, both literal and metaphorical. She connects her personal tragedy to the larger historical context of violence and injustice, positioning herself as a champion of the wronged. This intensifies the moral weight of her impending suicide.

**Literary Devices Highlighted:**

*   **Metaphor**: "tune thy woes," "Priam's painted wound," "quench Troy."
*   **Allusion**: To the Trojan War, Priam, Pyrrhus.
*   **Hyperbole**: "quench Troy that burns so long."
*   **Personification**: The dagger as an "instrument without a sound" that has "woes."

The stanza is full of dramatic irony, as we (the readers) know that she will use the dagger on herself, but the Greeks would want her to do that to Tarquin. In this stanza, she has an active intention, but she will use the dagger passively.
