# Stanza 18 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
For then is Tarquin brought unto his bed,
Intending weariness with heavy spright;
For, after supper, long he questioned
With modest Lucrece, and wore out the night:
Now leaden slumber with life's strength doth fight;
And every one to rest themselves betake,
Save thieves, and cares, and troubled minds, that wake.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Let's break down Shakespeare's stanza from *The Rape of Lucrece*, line by line, identifying literary devices:

* **"For then is Tarquin brought unto his bed,"**  This line introduces Tarquin, the antagonist, as he retires to his bed.  It sets the scene and establishes a sense of impending action.  The word "then" implies a chronological progression from previous events in the poem.

* **"Intending weariness with heavy spright;"** This line describes Tarquin's state of mind.  "Intending" here means "pretending" or "feigning."  He's putting on a show of weariness, despite his true intentions.  "Heavy spright" is a personification; "spright" (spirit) is given the human attribute of heaviness, suggesting a burdened or sluggish soul, which is deceptive.

* **"For, after supper, long he questioned / With modest Lucrece, and wore out the night:"** This explains Tarquin's pretense. He spent a long time talking with Lucrece, ostensibly to wear out the night and appear tired.  This establishes a contrast between his outward actions and his inner desires. The phrase "wore out the night" uses a metaphor ‚Äì  he's not just passing the time, he's wearing it down, suggesting a deliberate, manipulative strategy.

* **"Now leaden slumber with life's strength doth fight;"**  This line shifts focus to the overall atmosphere.  "Leaden slumber" is a metaphor; sleep is heavy and slow, like lead.  It's personified as fighting with "life's strength," indicating a struggle between rest and vitality, mirroring the internal conflict within Tarquin.

* **"And every one to rest themselves betake,"** This line describes the general descent into sleep, reinforcing the quiet before the storm. "Betake" means to apply or dedicate oneself.

* **"Save thieves, and cares, and troubled minds, that wake."** This line contrasts the sleeping majority with those who remain awake, setting a tone of ominous anticipation. The list ("thieves, and cares, and troubled minds") uses parallelism, highlighting the different types of unrest that prevent sleep.  Tarquin's own troubled mind, of course, is implied within this group.

**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza sets the scene for the rape. It depicts Tarquin's deceptive behavior, feigning tiredness after a long conversation with Lucrece, while secretly harboring sinister intentions. The contrast between the general sleep and the wakefulness of those with troubled minds creates suspense and foreshadows the violence to come. The imagery of "leaden slumber" battling "life's strength" reflects the internal struggle and the impending disruption of the peaceful night.  The stanza masterfully uses imagery, personification, metaphor, and parallelism to create a sense of dramatic irony and foreshadowing. We, the readers, are privy to Tarquin‚Äôs true intentions, while the other characters are unaware of the impending tragedy, creating a palpable tension.
