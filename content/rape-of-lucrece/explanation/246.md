# Stanza 246 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
Here with a sigh, as if her heart would break,
She throws forth Tarquin‚Äôs name: ‚ÄúHe, he,‚Äù she says,
But more than ‚Äúhe‚Äù her poor tongue could not speak;
Till after many accents and delays,
Untimely breathings, sick and short assays,
She utters this: ‚ÄúHe, he, fair lords, ‚Äôtis he,
That guides this hand to give this wound to me.‚Äù
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Let's break down Stanza 246 of Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece*:

**Part-by-Part Analysis:**

*   **"Here with a sigh, as if her heart would break,"**
    *   **"Here"**: Indicates a shift in focus, perhaps bringing the reader to Lucrece's current state or the climax of her suffering.
    *   **"with a sigh, as if her heart would break"**: Sets the emotional tone. The sigh is a physical manifestation of her immense grief and suffering.  The phrase "as if her heart would break" uses **simile** (comparing her state to a heart breaking), emphasizing the depth of her anguish. It foreshadows the imminent end.

*   **"She throws forth Tarquin‚Äôs name: ‚ÄúHe, he,‚Äù she says,"**
    *   **"She throws forth Tarquin's name"**:  A powerful verb "throws" suggests an explosive release, perhaps of the information, or a desperate attempt to name her violator. It could also represent her inability to hold back the truth.
    *   **"‚ÄúHe, he,‚Äù she says,"**: This is a fragmented and emotionally charged response. The repetition of "He" (a type of **anaphora**) reveals Lucrece's inability to fully articulate what happened. She is in shock and her articulation is failing.

*   **"But more than ‚Äúhe‚Äù her poor tongue could not speak;"**
    *   **"But more than ‚Äúhe‚Äù her poor tongue could not speak"**: Reinforces the idea of her distress and trauma. Her "poor tongue" is almost paralyzed by the horror she has experienced. The very act of speaking the name seems to be all she can manage at this point.

*   **"Till after many accents and delays,"**
    *   **"Till after many accents and delays"**: This clause introduces the difficulty and effort involved in the remainder of her speech. "Accents" could refer to the stress or emphasis in her words, indicating her physical difficulty in speaking. "Delays" highlights the pauses and hesitancy, reflecting her mental state.

*   **"Untimely breathings, sick and short assays,"**
    *   **"Untimely breathings"**: Implies that her breathing is irregular and possibly labored.
    *   **"sick and short assays"**: "Sick" suggests weakness and vulnerability. "Short assays" means brief attempts at speech. This builds a strong image of Lucrece's physical and emotional breakdown. The phrases use **alliteration**, further adding to the intensity and dramatic effect, "sick and short".

*   **"She utters this: ‚ÄúHe, he, fair lords, ‚Äôtis he,**"
    *   **"She utters this"**: After significant struggle, she finally manages a complete phrase. The action is a momentous release.
    *   **"He, he, fair lords, 'tis he,"**: This repetition of "he" (again, **anaphora**) emphasizes Tarquin's culpability, the "fair lords" being the witnesses who are present to hear her confession. The repetition makes it plain to all present who committed the crime.
*   **"That guides this hand to give this wound to me.‚Äù**
    *   **"That guides this hand to give this wound to me"**: The culmination of the stanza.  Lucrece accuses Tarquin of forcing her to commit suicide (the "wound").  This statement reveals not only the rape but also the final act - her self-inflicted death. The use of "guides" could be seen as a **metaphor**, suggesting that Tarquin has manipulated her to such an extent that she now believes the only honorable course of action is self-inflicted death. This is where she places blame squarely where it belongs.

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza marks a crucial moment in the poem. It is the culmination of Lucrece's immense suffering. It is her attempt to communicate the horrific act of rape and its devastating consequences. It conveys her struggle to articulate her pain and shame, as well as her determination to reveal the truth of Tarquin's actions. The stanza showcases her physical and emotional breakdown as she reveals Tarquin's role in her rape and suicide. It is her confession and final act of defiance.

**Literary Devices Summary:**

*   **Simile:** "as if her heart would break"
*   **Anaphora:** Repetition of "He" in several places.
*   **Alliteration:** "sick and short"
*   **Metaphor:** "That guides this hand"
