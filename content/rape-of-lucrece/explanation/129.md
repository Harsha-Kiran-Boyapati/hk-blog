# Stanza 129 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
'When wilt thou be the humble suppliant's friend,
And bring him where his suit may be obtain'd?
When wilt thou sort an hour great strifes to end?
Or free that soul which wretchedness hath chain'd?
Give physic to the sick, ease to the pain'd?
The poor, lame, blind, halt, creep, cry out for thee;
But they ne'er meet with Opportunity.
```

**Overall Meaning of the Stanza:**

The stanza is a lament, a cry of despair about the elusiveness of Opportunity, particularly for those who need it most. It highlights the suffering of the world and criticizes the unfairness of a system where the vulnerable are constantly denied the chance to improve their situations. Opportunity is personified and questioned about its absence. The stanza underscores the idea that Opportunity is not equally available to everyone and that those who are already disadvantaged often remain trapped in their suffering.

**Literary Devices:**

*   **Personification:** Opportunity is treated as a human being and is addressed as "thou." This personification allows the speaker to directly question and criticize Opportunity's actions (or lack thereof).
*   **Anaphora:** The repetition of "When wilt thou..." at the beginning of several lines emphasizes the speaker's frustration and the seemingly endless wait for Opportunity to act.
*   **Imagery:** The line "The poor, lame, blind, halt, creep, cry out for thee" creates a powerful image of suffering and evokes pity in the reader.
*   **Alliteration:** There is some subtle alliteration, such as "sick" and "soul" and "sort" and "strifes." These devices help the sounds connect and make the stanza more appealing.
*   **Irony:** There is a certain irony that Opportunity seems to be available to those who least need it and not to those who are desperate.

In conclusion, this stanza powerfully expresses the injustice of a world where opportunity is unevenly distributed, leaving the most vulnerable individuals to suffer without hope of relief.
