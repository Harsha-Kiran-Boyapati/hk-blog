# Stanza 230 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
Three times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire,
Ere once she can discharge one word of woe.
At length addressed to answer his desire,
She modestly prepares to let them know
Her honour is ta‚Äôen prisoner by the foe;
While Collatine and his consorted lords
With sad attention long to hear her words.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down this stanza from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* line by line, identifying the literary devices and then offering an overall interpretation.

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"Three times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire,"**
    *   *Meaning:* Lucrece sighs deeply three times, and these sighs are so intense they seem to fuel her sorrow, making it even stronger. Instead of reducing her sorrow, the sighing intensifies it as if it were stoking a fire.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Metaphor:** Sorrow is compared to "fire."  This suggests a burning, consuming pain.
        *   **Personification:** Sorrow is given the ability to be "given fire," implying it's a thing that can be fed and intensified.
        *   **Hyperbole:** "Three times" could be an exaggeration to emphasize the intensity of her suffering and hesitation.

*   **"Ere once she can discharge one word of woe."**
    *   *Meaning:* Before she can even utter a single word to express her grief and suffering, she has already sighed three times. It emphasises that she is trying to speak but the words are unable to be discharged as she is in shock.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Alliteration:** The repetition of the "w" sound in "word of woe" emphasizes the sorrow she is trying to express.

*   **"At length addressed to answer his desire,"**
    *   *Meaning:* Eventually, compelled to respond to the men's longing and expectation to hear her story, she prepares to speak. "Addressed to" implies both physically facing them and feeling compelled to speak to their shared desire for answers.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Implied Motivation:** "His desire" references the collective desire of Collatine and the other lords to know what has happened. This underscores their eagerness and the pressure Lucrece feels.

*   **"She modestly prepares to let them know"**
    *   *Meaning:* Lucrece, with appropriate modesty and shame, gets ready to reveal the terrible truth to the men. The word "modestly" is key here, highlighting her virtuous nature even in this moment of intense suffering.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Emphasis on Virtue:** "Modestly" continues to emphasize Lucrece's character. It highlights the tragic irony that she, a virtuous woman, has been subjected to such a violation.
        *   **Understatement:** "Let them know" softens the blow. The reality is far more horrific than simply "letting them know."

*   **"Her honour is ta‚Äôen prisoner by the foe;"**
    *   *Meaning:* Her reputation and virtue (her "honour") has been captured and defiled by the enemy (Tarquin). This is the central revelation she is about to make.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Metaphor:** "Honour" is personified as something that can be taken prisoner.  This highlights the intangible yet vital nature of reputation and virtue in the society of the play.
        *   **Euphemism:** "Ta'en prisoner by the foe" is a veiled way of referring to the rape. It avoids explicit language but makes it clear that she has been violated.

*   **"While Collatine and his consorted lords"**
    *   *Meaning:* All the men accompanying Collatine.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
         * **Alliteration:** The repetition of the "c" sound in "Collatine" and "consorted" emphasizes the group of men awaiting Lucrece's story.

*   **"With sad attention long to hear her words."**
    *   *Meaning:* Collatine and the other lords are listening with solemn attentiveness and are anxious to hear what she will say. They are ready to hear about the "foe" and how the matter can be avenged.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Irony:**  Their "sad attention" is tinged with a sense of anticipation.  They do not yet understand the full horror of what Lucrece is about to reveal, and their desire for information is a form of dramatic irony. They are long to hear a tragic story that will impact them all in a way they do not foresee.

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza captures the agonizing moment before Lucrece reveals the horror of her rape. She is overcome with shame and grief, struggling to find the words to describe what has happened. Her sighs become an outlet for her deep suffering. The men, eager and attentive, wait to hear her explanation, unaware of the full extent of the violation that has occurred. The language employed in this stanza creates a sense of dramatic tension and emphasizes the weight of Lucrece's words, highlighting the importance of reputation and virtue in the context of the story. Her honour is described metaphorically as having been taken prisoner by the enemy. The stanza prepares the reader for the devastating consequences of Tarquin's actions and sets the stage for Lucrece's subsequent suicide.
