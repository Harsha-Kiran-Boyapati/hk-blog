# Stanza 49 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
Now is he come unto the chamber-door,
That shuts him from the heaven of his thought,
Which with a yielding latch, and with no more,
Hath barr'd him from the blessed thing be sought.
So from himself impiety hath wrought,
That for his prey to pray he doth begin,
As if the heavens should countenance his sin.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis


**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"Now is he come unto the chamber-door,"**
    *   *Meaning:* This line establishes the immediate setting and action. Tarquin has arrived at Lucrece's bedroom door. It is a direct statement, setting the scene.
    *   *Literary Device:* **Enjambment** carries the reader forward, increasing anticipation.

*   **"That shuts him from the heaven of his thought,"**
    *   *Meaning:* This line uses metaphorical language. "The heaven of his thought" refers to the idealized, perhaps romanticized, vision Tarquin had of Lucrece or of achieving his desire. The door, a physical barrier, now separates him from this idealized vision. It suggests that the act of pursuing her physically is a corruption of his initial, perhaps more innocent, thoughts.
    *   *Literary Device:* **Metaphor:** Comparing his desire to "heaven".

*   **"Which with a yielding latch, and with no more,"**
    *   *Meaning:* The door is easily opened. The "yielding latch" suggests Lucrece's vulnerability and the ease with which Tarquin can overcome her physical defenses. "With no more" emphasizes how little resistance stands between him and his goal.
    *   *Literary Device:* **Understatement:** "With no more" minimizes the physical barrier but heightens the moral one.

*   **"Hath barr'd him from the blessed thing he sought."**
    *   *Meaning:* This line seems contradictory at first. He's physically at the door, about to seize Lucrece. But, it argues that the *act* itself has now removed him from actually obtaining what he *truly* desired. That 'blessed thing' is now tainted and no longer pure, and thus out of reach. A potential reading is that it is now tainted because of the sin he is about to commit.
    *   *Literary Device:* **Irony:** While he's physically closer to his goal, he's emotionally and morally further away from the "blessed thing." This also continues the heaven/hell theme.

*   **"So from himself impiety hath wrought,"**
    *   *Meaning:* This is a key line. "Impiety" (lack of reverence for the divine, wickedness) has originated from within Tarquin himself. His own immoral desires and actions have created this situation. He is the architect of his own downfall and moral corruption.
    *   *Literary Device:* **Personification:** "Impiety hath wrought" implies that the wicked act is actively working against him.

*   **"That for his prey to pray he doth begin,"**
    *   *Meaning:* This line is deeply disturbing and ironic. Tarquin, about to commit a heinous crime, paradoxically starts to pray. However, he's not praying for forgiveness or guidance. He is praying that the deed goes well. He's asking for divine assistance in his wicked pursuit of Lucrece as "prey".
    *   *Literary Device:* **Juxtaposition/Oxymoron:** The act of praying is contrasted with the immoral act he is about to commit. **Irony:** He seeks divine help for a profoundly ungodly act.

*   **"As if the heavens should countenance his sin."**
    *   *Meaning:* This line expresses the sheer audacity and delusion of Tarquin. He presumes, in his arrogance, that the heavens would condone or even support his sin. It highlights his complete lack of moral compass and his self-deception.
    *   *Literary Device:* **Irony:** The heavens would never condone such an act. **Hyperbole:** The idea that the heavens would "countenance his sin" exaggerates his delusion.

**Overall Meaning:**

Stanza 49 is a pivotal moment in the poem. It depicts Tarquin at the threshold, both physically and morally. The lines reveal the internal conflict and moral corruption that drive him. He has distanced himself from any idealized notion he had and embraced the reality of his sinful desire. His audacity is emphasized by the idea that he would pray for success in his crime, as if the heavens would endorse such wickedness. The stanza powerfully shows how he is the agent of his own downfall, the "impiety" originating from within. It sets the stage for the devastating consequences of his actions.

**Key Literary Devices Highlighted:**

*   **Metaphor:** Comparing his desire to "heaven."
*   **Irony:**  The disparity between his supposed desire and his actions, and the idea of praying for success in a sin.
*   **Juxtaposition/Oxymoron:** The contrast between prayer and the act of rape.
*   **Personification:** "Impiety hath wrought."
*   **Understatement:** "With no more" to emphasize the lack of true resistance.
*   **Hyperbole:** The idea that the heavens would "countenance his sin"
*   **Enjambment:**  Contributes to the sense of forward momentum and rising tension.

This stanza is a masterclass in characterization and dramatic tension, revealing Tarquin's internal state and foreshadowing the tragedy to come.
