# Stanza 1 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
FROM the besieged Ardea all in post,
Borne by the trustless wings of false desire,
Lust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host,
And to Collatium bears the lightless fire
Which, in pale embers hid, lurks to aspire
And girdle with embracing flames the waist
Of Collatine's fair love, Lucrece the chaste.
```

*   **"Borne by the trustless wings of false desire,"**
    *   **"Borne by":** Carried or propelled by.
    *   **"trustless wings of false desire":** This is a key phrase. Desire is personified as having "wings," adding a visual and suggesting the swiftness and potential instability of Tarquin's motivation. "False desire" reveals the destructive nature of his lust - it's not a noble feeling, but something deceptive and ultimately harmful.
    *   **Literary Device:** Metaphor (desire as having wings), Personification (desire), Alliteration (trustless).

*   **"Lust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host,"**
    *   **"Lust-breathed":** Tarquin is defined by his lust. He is literally "breathing" it, it consumes his very being.
    *   **"Tarquin leaves the Roman host":** Tarquin, a member of the royal family, abandons his military duty. This highlights his prioritizing of personal desire over duty.

    *   **Literary Device:** Metaphor (lust as lightless fire).

*   **"Which, in pale embers hid, lurks to aspire"**
    *   **"Which"**: Referring to the lightless fire, the lust.
    *   **"in pale embers hid":** The lust is not yet fully unleashed. It's smoldering, hidden, and potentially dangerous.
    *   **"lurks to aspire":** The fire of lust is waiting to become more intense, to consume. "Aspire" suggests an upward movement, a reaching for its goal (Lucrece).
    *   **Literary Device:** Imagery, alliteration (lurks, lightless).

*   **"And girdle with embracing flames the waist"**
    *   **"girdle with embracing flames":** Further development of the fire metaphor. The lust is now represented as encircling Lucrece. The flames will embrace her.
    *   **"the waist":** A reference to Lucrece's body, foreshadowing her violation.
    *   **Literary Device:** Metaphor (flames), alliteration (flames, waist).

*   **"Of Collatine's fair love, Lucrece the chaste."**
    *   **"Of Collatine's fair love, Lucrece the chaste":** This establishes the target of Tarquin's lust: Lucrece, the wife of Collatine, and emphasizing her virtue as "chaste".
    *   **Literary Device:** Antithesis (contrast between "fair love" and "chaste").

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza introduces the central conflict of the poem. It sets the scene: Tarquin, driven by uncontrolled lust (his "false desire"), abandons his military duty and rapidly travels to Collatium. His lust is portrayed as a "lightless fire" that he carries with him, a dangerous force that is hidden but smoldering. This fire is personified and presented as a threat that is about to envelop and destroy Lucrece, emphasizing her virtue and the impending tragic consequence. The swiftness of Tarquin's journey and the intensity of his desire create a sense of impending doom and foreboding. The stanza uses rich imagery, vivid metaphors, and personification to convey the destructive power of lust and the vulnerability of innocence.
