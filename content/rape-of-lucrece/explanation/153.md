# Stanza 153 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
'Nor shall he smile at thee in secret thought,
Nor laugh with his companions at thy state:

Basely with gold, but stol'n from forth thy gate.

And with my trespass never will dispense,
Till life to death acquit my forced offence.

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"Nor shall he smile at thee in secret thought,"**

    *   **Meaning:** Tarquin will not secretly gloat or feel amusement about what he did to Lucrece.  She ensures that this secret humiliation won't happen.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Negative Construction:**  The "Nor" emphasizes the absence of Tarquin's satisfaction.

*   **"Nor laugh with his companions at thy state:"**

    *   **Meaning:** Tarquin will not boast or joke with his friends about having violated her.  He won't publicly or privately revel in her degradation.

        *   **Parallelism:**  The structure mirrors the previous line, reinforcing the denial of Tarquin's potential joy.
        *   **Negative Construction:** Similar to the first line, the "Nor" continues the emphasis on what *won't* happen.

*   **"But thou shalt know thy interest was not bought"**

    *   **Meaning:**  Lucrece wants it to be known, that she did not give in to Tarquin for financial gain or some other base reason.  Her virtue was not something that could be purchased.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Direct Address:** "thou shalt know" directly speaks to the listener/reader, emphasizing the importance of this understanding.

*   **"Basely with gold, but stol'n from forth thy gate."**

    *   **Meaning:**  Her virtue/honor was not bought with gold, but forcibly taken from her, "stol'n from forth thy gate", meaning her home and being. It stresses the element of theft and violation.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Contrast/Antithesis:** "Basely with gold" is contrasted with "stol'n from forth thy gate," highlighting the difference between a willing transaction (buying) and violent seizure (theft).
        *   **Metaphor:** Her virtue/honor is treated as something physical that could be stolen.
        *   **Alliteration:** The repetition of "f" sounds in "stol'n from forth" creates a harsh, forceful effect.

*   **"For me, I am the mistress of my fate,"**

    *   **Meaning:** Lucrece asserts her control over her own destiny, even in the face of such a horrific violation. She will decide what happens next.
    *   **Literary Devices:**

*   **"And with my trespass never will dispense,"**

    *   **Meaning:** She will never forgive herself for this 'trespass' (here referring to the rape and its aftermath on her honor). She will not allow the violation to go unpunished, even if the 'punishment' is self-inflicted.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Euphemism:**  "My trespass" is a delicate way of referring to the rape, perhaps reflecting Lucrece's internal struggle to name the event directly.
        *   **Hyperbole:** She is overemphasizing that she will never forgive herself.

*   **"Till life to death acquit my forced offence."**

    *   **Meaning:** Only death will atone for the 'offence' that was forced upon her.  Only through death can she reclaim her honor.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Personification:** "Life" is personified as being able to "acquit" her offense, implying that living with the shame is itself a kind of sentence.
        *   **Irony:** The ultimate acquittal comes through death, a grim twist on the idea of justice.
        *   **Alliteration:** "forced offence" creates emphasis on the violation.

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza is crucial in understanding Lucrece's mindset and her impending suicide.  She is determined to take control of the narrative surrounding her rape. She ensures that Tarquin won't find joy in his victory and asserts that her virtue was not something easily compromised. She reclaims her agency, stating she is the "mistress of my fate," and that the only resolution for this horrible, forced violation is through death. The stanza shows Lucrece grappling with shame and honor, ultimately deciding that suicide is the only way to cleanse her stained reputation and prevent further exploitation. The stanza highlights themes of honor, reputation, control, and the devastating consequences of sexual violence. It foreshadows her suicide as the only way she can see to regain her lost virtue and control over her destiny. The language is powerful, and the use of literary devices underscores the gravity of her decision and her profound sense of violation.
