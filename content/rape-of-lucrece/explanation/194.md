# Stanza 194 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
His kindled duty kindled her mistrust,
That two red fires in both their faces blazed;
She thought he blushed, as knowing Tarquin‚Äôs lust,
And, blushing with him, wistly on him gazed.
Her earnest eye did make him more amazed.
The more she saw the blood his cheeks replenish,
The more she thought he spied in her some blemish.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down Stanza 194 of Shakespeare's "The Rape of Lucrece" line by line, then look at the overall meaning and literary devices:

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"His kindled duty kindled her mistrust,"**
    *   **His kindled duty:** Tarquin is trying to appear dutiful, respectful, and perhaps even chivalrous. He's trying to cloak his lust under the guise of polite concern for his hostess. "Kindled duty" suggests this "duty" is forced, manufactured, and brought to life for this specific moment.
    *   **kindled her mistrust:** This "duty" has the *opposite* effect on Lucrece. It *ignites* her suspicion. She becomes wary of his intentions. The repetition of "kindled" is *polyptoton*, using the same root word in different forms to emphasize the causal relationship, however ironically reversed.

*   **"That two red fires in both their faces blazed;"**
    *   **two red fires:** This is a *metaphor* for blushing. Both Tarquin and Lucrece are experiencing intense emotion, causing their faces to flush red.
    *   **in both their faces blazed:** The redness is visually vivid and intense, suggesting shame, fear, and/or guilt. The fact that *both* are blushing is significant.

*   **"She thought he blushed, as knowing Tarquin‚Äôs lust,"**
    *   **She thought he blushed:** Lucrece *interprets* Tarquin's blush as evidence that he *knows* the truth about Tarquin's lecherous nature. She assumes he's ashamed of his host's behavior, feeling guilty by association.
    *   **as knowing Tarquin's lust:** This reveals Lucrece's growing awareness of the danger she's in. She's beginning to suspect Tarquin's true motives.

*   **"And, blushing with him, wistly on him gazed."**
    *   **blushing with him:** Lucrece *herself* is blushing. This is crucial. Her blush is likely a mix of fear, embarrassment, and the growing realization of Tarquin's intent.
    *   **wistly on him gazed:** "Wistly" means attentively, with concern, and perhaps a touch of anxiety. Lucrece is carefully observing Tarquin, trying to decipher his intentions. The word "wistly" conveys a sense of foreboding.

*   **"Her earnest eye did make him more amazed."**
    *   **Her earnest eye:** Her sincere, serious gaze.
    *   **did make him more amazed:** Lucrece's intense observation unsettles Tarquin. He's surprised by her scrutiny and perhaps feels exposed, making him feel uneasy and further fuels his lustful obsession. "Amazed" here means confused, disconcerted, and perhaps even a little frightened.

*   **"The more she saw the blood his cheeks replenish,"**
    *   **The more she saw the blood his cheeks replenish:** As Lucrece observes Tarquin's deepening blush, confirming her suspicions, the more convinced she becomes that she is correct.

*   **"The more she thought he spied in her some blemish."**
    *   **he spied in her some blemish:** This is a crucial turning point. Lucrece projects her own growing sense of vulnerability and potential dishonor onto Tarquin. She fears that he sees something in her that makes her seem like an easy target or that he has already begun to sully her honor with his gaze. "Blemish" isn't necessarily a physical flaw; it's a moral flaw or a vulnerability. This is the moment when Lucrece begins to feel like she is already damaged, as if the violation has already begun, even before the physical act.

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza is a powerful depiction of the escalating tension and miscommunication between Lucrece and the disguised Tarquin. Lucrece interprets Tarquin's (presumed) blushing and behavior as evidence of his knowledge of Tarquin's lustful intent, sparking her mistrust. However, her own fear and awareness of the danger lead her to believe that Tarquin sees her as vulnerable or flawed, making her a target for his vile intentions. The stanza is steeped in irony, as both characters misread each other's emotions, contributing to the tragic trajectory of the narrative. This stanza reveals the moment Lucrece realizes that her honor is in danger, a sense of dread and defilement descends upon her.

**Literary Devices:**

*   **Metaphor:** "two red fires" for blushing
*   **Polyptoton:** "kindled duty kindled her mistrust"
*   **Irony:** The "duty" is actually fueling mistrust.
*   **Dramatic Irony:** We, the audience, know Tarquin's true intentions, which heightens the tension.
*   **Imagery:** The vivid descriptions of blushing ("red fires," "blood his cheeks replenish") create a strong visual impact.
*   **Foreshadowing:** The stanza hints at the impending tragedy and the corruption of Lucrece's innocence.
*   **Psychological Realism:** Shakespeare masterfully captures the complex and shifting emotions of both characters, particularly Lucrece's growing fear and self-doubt.
