# Stanza 158 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
So she, deep-drenched in a sea of care,
Holds disputation with each thing she views,
And to herself all sorrow doth compare;
No object but her passion's strength renews;
And as one shifts, another straight ensues:
Sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words;
Sometime 'tis mad and too much talk affords.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down this stanza from *The Rape of Lucrece* line by line and then put it all together:

*   **Line 1: "So she, deep-drenched in a sea of care,"**

    *   **Breakdown:** This line paints a vivid picture of Lucrece's mental state. "Deep-drenched" implies she is completely consumed and overwhelmed. "A sea of care" is a powerful metaphor, comparing her worries and anxieties to an immense and dangerous body of water.
    *   **Literary Device:**
        *   **Metaphor:** The comparison of "care" to a "sea" is a clear metaphor, suggesting the vastness and all-encompassing nature of her distress.
        *   **Imagery:** The phrase "deep-drenched in a sea" creates strong visual and tactile imagery, allowing the reader to feel Lucrece's overwhelming despair.

*   **Line 2: "Holds disputation with each thing she views,"**

    *   **Breakdown:**  "Disputation" means argument or debate.  Lucrece is mentally arguing with everything she sees around her. She's not simply observing; she's engaging in a tortured internal dialogue, probably questioning everything and seeking answers or justifications (likely futile).
    *   **Literary Device:**
        *   **Personification (Implied):** Suggests that the "things" she views are capable of engaging in an argument.

*   **Line 3: "And to herself all sorrow doth compare;"**

    *   **Breakdown:** She is measuring all forms of sorrow to her own. She sees her grief as the ultimate standard of suffering. She is constantly assessing how her suffering compares to the suffering of others.
    *   **Literary Device:**
        *   **Imagery:** Evokes a sense of scale and comparison.

*   **Line 4: "No object but her passion's strength renews;"**

    *   **Breakdown:**  "Passion" here refers to the intense suffering and pain she is experiencing. "No object" means that everything she sees, no matter how small, reminds her of her trauma and intensifies her feelings. Instead of distracting her, her surroundings only reinforce her pain.
    *   **Literary Device:**
        *   **Hyperbole (Possible):** Implies that literally *everything* she sees reminds her of her trauma. This is likely an exaggeration for emphasis.
        *   **Irony:** Irony is present because one would expect outside influences to provide a distraction or relief to her suffering, not add to it.

*   **Line 5: "And as one shifts, another straight ensues:"**

    *   **Breakdown:** As one object or thought fades from her attention, another quickly takes its place, continuing the cycle of torment. There's no respite or pause in her suffering.
    *   **Literary Device:**
        *   **Imagery:** Creates a sense of relentless succession of tormenting thoughts.

*   **Line 6: "Sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words;"**

    *   **Breakdown:** Sometimes, her grief is so profound that she is speechless. She is incapable of articulating the depth of her pain. She's beyond words.
    *   **Literary Device:**
        *   **Contrast:** Sets up a contrast with the next line.

*   **Line 7: "Sometime 'tis mad and too much talk affords."**

    *   **Breakdown:** At other times, her grief manifests as madness and uncontrolled talking. She becomes almost manic in her outpouring of pain and despair. She is unable to contain herself.
    *   **Literary Device:**
        *   **Contrast:**  Directly contrasts with the previous line, showing the volatile and unpredictable nature of her grief.  This is **antithesis**.

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza depicts the intense and overwhelming emotional turmoil that Lucrece experiences after the rape. She is utterly consumed by her grief, which is constantly renewed by her surroundings. Her mental state is volatile and unpredictable, fluctuating between speechless despair and frantic, uncontrolled outpouring of pain. The stanza emphasizes the relentless and inescapable nature of her suffering. It highlights the psychological impact of the rape, demonstrating how it has shattered her inner peace and plunged her into a sea of anguish. She is stuck in a vicious cycle of trauma and mental anguish that she can't escape from.
