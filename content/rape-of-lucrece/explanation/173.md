# Stanza 173 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
'Thou, Collatine, shalt oversee this will;
How was I overseen that thou shalt see it!
My blood shall wash the slander of mine ill;
My life's foul deed, my life's fair end shall free it.
Faint not, faint heart, but stoutly say 'So be it:'
Yield to my hand; my hand shall conquer thee:
Thou dead, both die, and both shall victors be.'
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down Stanza 173 of Shakespeare's 'The Rape of Lucrece' line by line:

**Line 1: 'Thou, Collatine, shalt oversee this will;'**

*   **Breakdown:**
    *   "Thou, Collatine": Direct address to her husband, Collatine.
    *   "shalt oversee this will": You will be the executor of this, referring to her dying wishes, or perhaps a more metaphorical "will" - her desire for justice.
*   **Meaning:** Lucrece is telling Collatine that he is responsible for carrying out the consequences of her death, ensuring her actions are understood.

**Line 2: 'How was I overseen that thou shalt see it!'**

*   **Breakdown:**
    *   "How was I overseen": A double meaning; how could she have been so negligent to allow the rape to happen, and also, how was she misunderstood or underestimated to have been targeted in this way? "Overseen" could also hint at a sense of divine watchfulness, implying a question of why she was not protected.
    *   "that thou shalt see it!": That you will now understand the consequences of what has happened (because of her death and explanation)
*   **Meaning:** She laments her vulnerability and the fact that Collatine will only truly understand the gravity of the situation *after* her death and her explanation. It's a cry of pain and a subtle accusation that he should have protected her better.

**Line 3: 'My blood shall wash the slander of mine ill;'**

*   **Breakdown:**
    *   "My blood shall wash": Alliteration and metaphor. The alliteration of "blood" and "wash" emphasizes the cleansing action. The "blood" symbolizes her sacrifice and the "slander of mine ill" is the shame or guilt associated with being raped.
    *   "the slander of mine ill": The false accusations or rumors surrounding her "ill" (the rape), which is seen as a stain on her honor.
*   **Meaning:** Her suicide, the shedding of her blood, will cleanse her reputation from the shame and false accusations brought about by Tarquin's act. She believes suicide is the only way to restore her honor.

**Line 4: 'My life's foul deed, my life's fair end shall free it.'**

*   **Breakdown:**
    *   "My life's foul deed": Ambiguous. Could refer to the rape itself, which she internalizes as a "deed," or to her act of suicide. In either case, it suggests a deeply personal sense of responsibility or shame.
    *   "my life's fair end shall free it": Her honorable (or at least perceived-as-honorable) death will liberate or exonerate her from the foul deed/shame. Juxtaposition between "foul deed" and "fair end".
*   **Meaning:** Her honorable death, in her view, will liberate her from the shame of the rape and/or the "foul deed" of taking her own life. Again, she sees death as the only path to freedom and redemption.

**Line 5: 'Faint not, faint heart, but stoutly say 'So be it:'**

*   **Breakdown:**
    *   "Faint not, faint heart": Apostrophe (addressing an inanimate object - her heart). Repetition of "faint" emphasizes her internal struggle and fear.
    *   "but stoutly say 'So be it:'": urging herself to be strong and accept her fate, to affirm her decision to die.
*   **Meaning:** She is encouraging herself to be brave and accept her fate, to follow through with her plan, even though she is afraid.

**Line 6: 'Yield to my hand; my hand shall conquer thee:'**

*   **Breakdown:**
    *   "Yield to my hand": This is complex. "My hand" literally refers to the hand that will take her own life. "Yield" suggests a surrender to death.
    *   "My hand shall conquer thee": Paradoxical. Her hand, acting as the instrument of her death, will paradoxically conquer "thee" - which could refer to the shame, the dishonor, or even to Tarquin's act itself.
*   **Meaning:** She commands herself to surrender to the act of suicide, believing that by killing herself, she will conquer the shame and dishonor brought upon her.

**Line 7: 'Thou dead, both die, and both shall victors be.'**

*   **Breakdown:**
    *   "Thou dead": Refers to herself after death.
    *   "both die": Complex and open to interpretation. "Both" could refer to:
        *   Her body and her shame: Her physical self will die, and so will the shame she feels.
        *   Herself and Tarquin (metaphorically): Her death will bring about the "death" of Tarquin's power, reputation, and potentially his life. This could be seen as a call for justice.
    *   "both shall victors be": The ultimate paradox. Victory is achieved through death.
*   **Meaning:** Through her death, she hopes to eradicate both herself and the dishonor she feels, and perhaps symbolically defeat Tarquin. It's a twisted victory, achieved through sacrifice. She believes that her suicide will ultimately lead to a form of justice or redemption.

**Overall Meaning of the Stanza:**

The stanza is full of paradoxes, ambiguities, and internal conflict, highlighting the complex and tragic nature of her situation. It showcases her deep sense of shame, her determination to reclaim her honor, and her belief that death is the only way to achieve these goals. The stanza acts as a pivotal moment in the poem, illustrating Lucrece's tragic decision and her complex justification for taking her own life.
