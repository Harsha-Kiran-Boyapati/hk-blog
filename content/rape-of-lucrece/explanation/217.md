# Stanza 217 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
But, like a constant and confirmed devil,
He entertained a show so seeming just,
And therein so ensconced his secret evil,
That jealousy itself could not mistrust
False-creeping craft and perjury should thrust
Into so bright a day such black-faced storms,
Or blot with hell-born sin such saint-like forms.
```

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza paints a picture of Tarquin as a master deceiver. He meticulously crafts an outward appearance of honor and righteousness, so convincing that even the most suspicious of minds (personified as jealousy) would not suspect the evil he harbors. His intentions are to corrupt and defile something pure and innocent ("bright day," "saint-like forms") with his diabolical ("hell-born sin") actions. The stanza builds tension by foreshadowing the act of violence and betrayal to come, highlighting the contrast between Tarquin's facade and his true, evil nature. The language is deliberately dramatic and evocative, using powerful imagery to convey the magnitude of the impending tragedy.
