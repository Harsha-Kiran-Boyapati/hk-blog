# Stanza 169 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
'Yet die I will not till my Collatine
Have heard the cause of my untimely death;
That he may vow, in that sad hour of mine,

Which by him tainted shall for him be spent,
And as his due writ in my testament.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down Stanza 169 of Shakespeare's "The Rape of Lucrece" line by line, identify the literary devices, and then provide an overall meaning.

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"Yet die I will not till my Collatine"**
    *   **Literal Meaning:**  Despite everything, I will not die until my husband, Collatine,
    *   **Analysis:**  This line reveals Lucrece's resolve.  Even in the face of death, she has a purpose to fulfill. "Collatine" is used in place of "My husband".

*   **"Have heard the cause of my untimely death;"**
    *   **Literal Meaning:** Has heard the reason for my death, which has happened before its proper time.
    *   **Analysis:** "Untimely death" emphasizes the injustice and tragedy of her situation. Lucrece is robbed of the natural course of her life.

*   **"That he may vow, in that sad hour of mine,"**
    *   **Literal Meaning:** So that he may make a solemn promise (vow) during my last, sorrowful moments,
    *   **Analysis:**  Lucrece's primary concern is not simply her own demise, but what comes after.  She wants Collatine to make a vow. "Sad hour of mine" refers to the time of her death.

*   **"Revenge on him that made me stop my breath."**
    *   **Literal Meaning:** To take revenge on the man who caused my death.
    *   **Analysis:**  The "him that made me stop my breath" is, of course, Tarquin.  This clarifies the nature of the vow she wants Collatine to make: revenge.

*   **"My stained blood to Tarquin I'll bequeath,"**
    *   **Literal Meaning:** I will leave (bequeath) my defiled/shamed blood to Tarquin.
    *   **Analysis:** This is a powerful and somewhat metaphorical line.  Lucrece sees her blood as now belonging to Tarquin because he has tainted it through his crime. "Stained blood" refers to the blood she associates with her rape and ruined reputation. "Bequeath" implies she is giving it to him, but with a sinister intention.

*   **"Which by him tainted shall for him be spent,"**
    *   **Literal Meaning:**  The blood which he defiled will ultimately be used up (spent) on him.
    *   **Analysis:** This line suggests that Tarquin will be punished for what he has done, and the consequences of his actions will consume him.  Her blood, tainted by him, will be the instrument of his downfall.

*   **"And as his due writ in my testament."**
    *   **Literal Meaning:**  And this (his punishment) will be written in my final will (testament) as something he deserves.
    *   **Analysis:** Lucrece frames her death and the quest for revenge as a formal legal matter. She is making it her final wish. "His due" emphasizes the idea of justice and retribution.  The "testament" creates a sense of formality and finality.

**Literary Devices:**

*   **Irony:**  Lucrece "bequeathing" her stained blood to Tarquin is deeply ironic.  She's not giving him a gift; she's passing on a curse, a burden, and a demand for vengeance.
*   **Metaphor:** The "stained blood" is a metaphor for Lucrece's dishonored reputation and the injustice she has suffered.
*   **Foreshadowing:**  The lines hint at the eventual downfall of Tarquin, suggesting that his actions will have dire consequences.
*   **Alliteration**: "made me"
*   **Assonance**: "death/breath"

**Overall Meaning:**

In this stanza, Lucrece is determined to ensure that her death has meaning and purpose. She will not die in silence or without seeking justice. She delays her death specifically to compel her husband, Collatine, to vow revenge against Tarquin. She frames her death and the act of revenge as her final will, ensuring that Tarquin's punishment is seen as a deserved and legally mandated consequence of his crime. The "stained blood" is a powerful symbol of Tarquin's corruption and the curse that Lucrece places upon him, suggesting that his actions will ultimately lead to his destruction.  She is taking control of her narrative and ensuring that her voice is heard, even in death. Her goal is to spark action that will avenge her honor and punish Tarquin. The stanza highlights the themes of revenge, justice, honor, and the power of words and vows in the face of extreme injustice.
