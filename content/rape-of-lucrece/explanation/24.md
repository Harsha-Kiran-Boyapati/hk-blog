# Stanza 24 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
Now stole upon the time the dead of night,
When heavy sleep had closed up mortal eyes:
No comfortable star did lend his light,
No noise but owls' and wolves' death-boding cries;
Now serves the season that they may surprise
The silly lambs: pure thoughts are dead and still,
While lust and murder wake to stain and kill.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Let's break down Shakespeare's stanza from *The Rape of Lucrece*, line by line:

* **"Now stole upon the time the dead of night,"**  This sets the scene.  "Stole" personifies night, suggesting its quiet, stealthy arrival. "Dead of night" emphasizes the deepest, darkest part of the night, a time associated with vulnerability and danger.

* **"When heavy sleep had closed up mortal eyes:"** This continues the setting, emphasizing the pervasive stillness and vulnerability of those asleep. "Heavy sleep" suggests a deep, unconscious slumber, making people defenseless.

* **"No comfortable star did lend his light,"** This builds suspense and foreshadows the impending violence. The absence of starlight creates darkness, both literally and metaphorically, symbolizing the lack of guidance and protection.  The use of "comfortable" is interesting; stars are usually associated with comfort, but their absence amplifies the discomfort and danger.

* **"No noise but owls' and wolves' death-boding cries;"** This uses **onomatopoeia** (the sounds mirroring the meaning‚Äî though not explicitly sounded out) and creates a terrifying atmosphere. Owls and wolves, traditionally associated with death and ill omen, further intensify the sense of foreboding.  The "death-boding cries" are a clear sign of impending doom.

* **"Now serves the season that they may surprise"** This line shifts the focus, indicating the opportune moment for the villains to act. "Season" here refers to the time and the circumstances, ideal for their nefarious plans.

* **"The silly lambs: pure thoughts are dead and still,"** This line introduces a metaphor. "Silly lambs" represent innocence and purity (Lucrece). "Pure thoughts are dead and still" suggests that virtue and innocence are passive and vulnerable in the face of evil.  This is a powerful juxtaposition, highlighting the helplessness of the innocent against the forces of darkness.

* **"While lust and murder wake to stain and kill."** This is the climax of the stanza.  "Lust and murder" personified, are actively engaged and awake, ready to commit their vile acts.  "Stain and kill" vividly depicts the physical and moral corruption that will follow.  The use of **parallelism** with "stain and kill" emphasizes the dual nature of the impending crime‚Äî both physical violation and the corruption of innocence.


**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza establishes a dark and ominous atmosphere, perfectly setting the stage for the rape of Lucrece.  It uses vivid imagery and personification to contrast the vulnerability of innocence (represented by the "silly lambs" and "pure thoughts") with the active malevolence of lust and murder, personified and empowered by the darkness of night.  The absence of comforting light and the presence of death-boding cries heighten the sense of impending doom and foreshadow the devastating events to come.  The stanza is a masterclass in creating suspense and highlighting the thematic conflict between innocence and evil that dominates the poem.
