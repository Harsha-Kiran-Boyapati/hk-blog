# Stanza 247 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
A harmful knife, that thence her soul unsheathed.
That blow did bail it from the deep unrest
Of that polluted prison where it breathed.
Her contrite sighs unto the clouds bequeathed
Her winged sprite, and through her wounds doth fly
Life‚Äôs lasting date from cancelled destiny.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Let's break down this powerful stanza from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece*:

**Line by Line Breakdown and Literary Devices:**

*   **"Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast"**
    *   **Meaning:** Lucrece, in this very moment, plunges a knife into her body.
    *   **"Even here"**: This phrase emphasizes the immediacy and finality of the action.
    *   **"sheathed":** This is a strong verb choice; it typically describes putting a weapon *into* its container. The unexpected use of the word here highlights the violence of her act.
    *   **"harmless breast":** This is ironic. The breast, the seat of life, is described as "harmless" before being tragically violated.

*   **"A harmful knife, that thence her soul unsheathed."**
    *   **Meaning:** She uses a knife (a weapon) to take her own life and free her soul.
    *   **"A harmful knife":** Obvious - this shows how the action will affect Lucrece.
    *   **"unsheathed":** This is a metaphorical extension of "sheathed". Just as the knife was "sheathed" in her body, the knife now "unsheathed" her soul, separating it from her body. This emphasizes the dual nature of the act - physical violence and spiritual release.
    *   **Literary Device**: Antithesis (juxtaposition of contrasting ideas), as the first line mentioned a 'harmless breast', and now there's a 'harmful knife'. It also uses personification.

*   **"That blow did bail it from the deep unrest"**
    *   **Meaning:** The stab freed her soul from the turmoil of her experience (specifically, from her shame and the violation she suffered).
    *   **"That blow"**: Direct reference to the act of suicide.
    *   **"bail it from the deep unrest"**: "Bail" suggests setting free, and "deep unrest" conveys the emotional and psychological torment Lucrece endures.
    *   **Literary Device**: Metaphor of a prison, as she's 'bailed' from a place of unrest.

*   **"Of that polluted prison where it breathed."**
    *   **Meaning:** The body itself, where her soul once lived, is now a "polluted prison" because of the rape and its subsequent moral decay and shame.
    *   **"polluted prison":** This harsh image symbolizes the degradation and violation of her body. The corruption is internal, not external; she feels her body is ruined.
    *   **"where it breathed":** This implies that her body was once a place of life, before this tragedy.
    *   **Literary Device**: Metaphor: The body is described as a "polluted prison". This is a strong metaphor for the degradation and violation Lucrece has suffered.

*   **"Her contrite sighs unto the clouds bequeathed"**
    *   **Meaning:** Her deep, sorrowful sighs are given to the heavens (the clouds).
    *   **"contrite sighs":** Highlights her remorse and regret, likely not only for the rape, but for the dishonor she fears she has brought to her family.
    *   **"bequeathed":** This is a legal term, usually used to describe giving something to someone after death. It further emphasizes the finality of the action and the soul's departure.
    *   **Literary Device**: Personification: The sighs are "bequeathed," giving them agency and a sense of communication with the heavens.

*   **"Her winged sprite, and through her wounds doth fly"**
    *   **Meaning:** Her soul ("winged sprite") flies away from her body through her wounds.
    *   **"winged sprite":** Refers to her soul, using the idea of a spirit or essence.
    *   **"through her wounds doth fly":** This emphasizes the physical reality of her death and the soul's escape. The wounds are the gateway.
    *   **Literary Device**: Metaphor (soul as a winged sprite).

*   **"Life‚Äôs lasting date from cancelled destiny."**
    *   **Meaning:** Suicide has abruptly ended her life (the "date" she was meant to live) and has, in effect, cancelled the future she might have had.
    *   **"Life‚Äôs lasting date":** Refers to the length of her life.
    *   **"cancelled destiny":** Emphasizes the ending of her fate - how the act of suicide has changed her trajectory.
    *   **Literary Device**: Metaphor: "Life's lasting date" is a metaphor for her life.

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza is a powerful description of Lucrece's suicide. It highlights the following key themes:

*   **Loss of Honor and Purity:** The rape has utterly violated Lucrece. She views her body as "polluted," a prison, and believes her honor is irretrievably lost.
*   **Suicide as an Act of Freedom:**  Lucrece sees suicide as a way to escape the pain and shame, a way to "bail" her soul from its torment.
*   **The Finality of Death:**  Shakespeare emphasizes the act of suicide, with the use of strong verbs, metaphors and imagery.
*   **The Aftermath:** Lucrece's spirit departs, and her death has changed her destiny.

Shakespeare masterfully uses language and imagery to convey the depth of Lucrece's despair, the violence of her act, and the finality of her death. The metaphors create vivid pictures, while the use of personification adds emotional weight.
