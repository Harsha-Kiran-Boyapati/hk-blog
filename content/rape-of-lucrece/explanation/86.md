# Stanza 86 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
'In Tarquin's likeness I did entertain thee:
Hast thou put on his shape to do him shame?
To all the host of heaven I complain me,
Thou wrong'st his honour, wound'st his princely name.
Thou art not what thou seem'st; and if the same,
Thou seem'st not what thou art, a god, a king;
For kings like gods should govern everything.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down this stanza from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* and then discuss its overall meaning:

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"In Tarquin's likeness I did entertain thee:"**
    *   *Meaning:* "I welcomed you into my home because you seemed to be a man like Tarquin (Lucrece's husband's friend, Sextus Tarquinius, who is currently inside her house). I believed you were trustworthy and honorable, like him."
    *   *Literary Devices:* This line sets the stage with dramatic irony. Lucrece *believed* she was welcoming someone like her husband's friend, but the audience knows the true, treacherous nature of Tarquin, who is about to betray her trust.

*   **"Hast thou put on his shape to do him shame?"**
    *   *Meaning:* "Have you disguised yourself as Tarquin, in order to bring dishonor to him? Are you pretending to be his friend only to betray him and ruin his reputation?"
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   *Rhetorical Question:* Lucrece is expressing her outrage and disbelief; she's not necessarily seeking an answer.
        *   *Irony:* The irony is that Tarquin *is* using his position (and his resemblance to his namesake) to betray Tarquin, but in a far more heinous way than just shaming his reputation.

*   **"To all the host of heaven I complain me,"**
    *   *Meaning:* "I appeal to all the heavenly beings (angels, gods) to witness this injustice."
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   *Invocation/Appeal:* A common device in classical and Renaissance literature, calling upon higher powers to witness or aid. This elevates the scene and emphasizes the enormity of the wrong being committed.

*   **"Thou wrong'st his honour, wound'st his princely name."**
    *   *Meaning:* "You are injuring Tarquin's honor and damaging his noble reputation."
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   *Metaphor:* Honor and name are treated as things that can be wounded, emphasizing their importance in the social and political context of the time.
        *   *Synecdoche:* "Princely name" refers to the entirety of Tarquin's noble standing and reputation.

*   **"Thou art not what thou seem'st; and if the same,"**
    *   *Meaning:* "You are not what you appear to be; and even if you are the same person I thought,..."
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   *Antithesis:* The line sets up a contradiction between appearance and reality.
        *   *Paradox:* Suggests two conflicting states: that Tarquin is not who he seems and, even if he is the person she thought he was, he now seems different from who she thought he was. This highlights the jarring dissonance in Lucrece's understanding of Tarquin.

*   **"Thou seem'st not what thou art, a god, a king;"**
    *   *Meaning:* "...You do not act like what you truly are meant to be, namely a god or a king (or, at least, a noble prince)."
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   *Antithesis:* Continuing the theme of appearance versus reality.
        *   *Hyperbole:* Exaggerating Tarquin's position to emphasize the gravity of his betrayal. In essence, she is saying that his position should make him morally superior.

*   **"For kings like gods should govern everything."**
    *   *Meaning:* "Because kings (and princes) like gods should rule justly and with wisdom in all matters."
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   *Simile:* Comparing kings to gods emphasizes the expected moral authority and responsibility of rulers.
        *   *Implied Social Commentary:* This line reflects the contemporary belief in the divine right of kings. It suggests that kings have a duty to uphold justice and virtue because they are seen as representatives of God on Earth.

**Overall Meaning of the Stanza:**

In this stanza, Lucrece, realizing the horrific intentions of Tarquin, confronts him. She expresses her shock and betrayal, emphasizing the vast difference between his outward appearance and his true, wicked nature. She appeals to divine justice and accuses him of dishonoring his name and position. She appeals to the standards expected of nobility and royalty, suggesting that rulers, like gods, should embody justice, honor, and moral governance. Her outrage is fueled by the belief that Tarquin, by his actions, is violating not only her personal honor but also the sacred trust placed in those in positions of power. The stanza highlights the theme of appearance versus reality and the importance of morality and justice in leadership.
