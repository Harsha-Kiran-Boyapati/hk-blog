# Stanza 55 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
O, had they in that darksome prison died!
Then had they seen the period of their ill;
Then Collatine again, by Lucrece' side,
In his clear bed might have reposed still:
But they must ope, this blessed league to kill;
And holy-thoughted Lucrece to their sight
Must sell her joy, her life, her world's delight.
```

    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Exclamatory O:** Conveys intense emotion, grief, and longing.
        *   **"Darksome prison":**  Metaphor. It refers to Lucrece's bedroom, which has become a place of torment and potential violation. The "darkness" suggests evil, secrecy, and the moral darkness of the act.
        *   **Alliteration:** "Darksome died" emphasizes the negativity.

    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **"Period":** Here, "period" means ending or conclusion. It has the additional, subtle connotation of a full stop on a sentence ‚Äì absolute finality.
        *   **Irony:** The line describes death as the "period of their ill," which is a common sentiment when discussing the end of suffering, but in this context, their death would have prevented the much greater ill of Lucrece's rape.
*   **Line 3: "Then Collatine again, by Lucrece' side,"**
    *   *Meaning:* Then Collatine (Lucrece's husband) could have been with Lucrece again.

    *   *Literary Devices:*

    *   *Meaning:* And Lucrece, a woman of pure and virtuous thoughts, must be presented to their view.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Epithet:** "Holy-thoughted Lucrece" is a descriptive phrase that emphasizes her virtuous nature. It serves to highlight the injustice of her fate.

    *   *Meaning:* Must forfeit her happiness, her life, and everything that makes the world beautiful (or "her world's delight").
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Metaphor:** "Sell her joy, her life, her world's delight" - Lucrece won't literally sell these things, but she will lose them due to the actions of Tarquin. "Sell" also suggests a sense of betrayal and loss of control. She is a victim.
        *   **Climax:** The line is the climax of the stanza, escalating the consequences. "Joy" is something personal, "life" is fundamental, and "world's delight" encompasses everything positive.
