# Stanza 29 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
'O shame to knighthood and to shining arms!
O foul dishonour to my household's grave!
O impious act, including all foul harms!
A martial man to be soft fancy's slave!
True valour still a true respect should have;
Then my digression is so vile, so base,
That it will live engraven in my face.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
This stanza from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* is a powerful expression of Lucrece's self-reproach and shame following her rape by Tarquin. Let's break down each line:

* **"O shame to knighthood and to shining arms!"**  This line invokes the imagery of chivalry and military prowess, ideals associated with Tarquin's status as a nobleman and soldier.  Lucrece is highlighting the hypocrisy of his actions, suggesting his supposed honour is a sham.  The "shining arms" are a metonym for military glory and noble status.  The "O" is an example of **apostrophe**, directly addressing abstract concepts (shame, knighthood).

* **"O foul dishonour to my household's grave!"** This refers to the dishonour brought upon her family's lineage and reputation.  "Household's grave" symbolizes the ancestral line and the lasting stain the rape will leave on her family's name.

* **"O impious act, including all foul harms!"** This line emphasizes the wickedness and gravity of the act.  "Impious" highlights the religious transgression, and "including all foul harms" emphasizes its encompassing nature‚Äîthe damage done extends beyond the physical violation.

* **"A martial man to be soft fancy's slave!"** This line is a stark contrast.  "Martial man" again points to Tarquin's warrior image, while "soft fancy's slave" depicts him as controlled by lust ("soft fancy" is a euphemism for sexual desire). This is an example of **oxymoron**, juxtaposing opposing qualities.  It underscores the unexpected weakness behind his outward strength.

* **"True valour still a true respect should have;"** This line establishes a moral standard ‚Äì true courage should be accompanied by respect for others.  This is in direct contradiction to Tarquin's behavior.

* **"Then my digression is so vile, so base,"** This is Lucrece's self-condemnation. "Digression" refers to her yielding to Tarquin's advances, implying a deviation from virtue and proper conduct.  The repetition of "so" emphasizes the profound nature of her shame.

* **"That it will live engraven in my face."** This final line utilizes powerful imagery. Lucrece believes the shame of her rape will be permanently etched onto her face, a visual and lasting representation of her trauma. This foreshadows her suicide and the enduring nature of the dishonor.


**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza is a profound expression of Lucrece's despair and self-blame.  It is not merely a lament, but a complex exploration of the societal expectations placed upon women, the hypocrisy of masculinity, and the lasting damage of sexual violence.  She uses the language of chivalry and honor to highlight the violation of those very principles by Tarquin, internalizing the societal standards that judged her more harshly than her attacker.  The stanza highlights the devastating psychological impact of rape, showing how a woman might internalize the shame and blame imposed upon her by a patriarchal society.  The strong imagery and rhetorical devices emphasize the intensity of her emotional turmoil.
