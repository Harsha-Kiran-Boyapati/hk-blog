# Stanza 218 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
The well-skilled workman this mild image drew
For perjured Sinon, whose enchanting story
The credulous Old Priam after slew;
Whose words like wildfire burnt the shining glory
Of rich-built Ilion, that the skies were sorry,
And little stars shot from their fixed places,
When their glass fell wherein they viewed their faces.
```

Sinon's lies, like a wildfire, consumed the glorious city of Troy, causing such profound devastation that even the heavens mourned, and the cosmos itself seemed to be disrupted. The shattered "glass" symbolizes the utter destruction of Troy's beauty and order, and the distorted reflection represents the triumph of deception over truth.
