# Stanza 203 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
Here one man‚Äôs hand leaned on another‚Äôs head,
His nose being shadowed by his neighbour‚Äôs ear;
Here one being thronged bears back, all boll‚Äôn and red;
Another smothered seems to pelt and swear;
And in their rage such signs of rage they bear
As, but for loss of Nestor‚Äôs golden words,
It seemed they would debate with angry swords.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down stanza 203 of Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* line by line, and then analyze its overall meaning and literary devices:

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"Here one man‚Äôs hand leaned on another‚Äôs head,"**
    *   *Meaning:* Describes a chaotic, crowded scene where people are physically pressed together. One man is so close to another that he's using the other's head for support, likely in a struggle. This emphasizes the lack of order and respect for personal space.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Imagery:** Creates a vivid picture of the jostling crowd.

*   **"His nose being shadowed by his neighbour‚Äôs ear;"**
    *   *Meaning:* Continues the description of the crush. The men are packed so tightly that one man's nose is literally in the shadow of another's ear. It's a graphic and somewhat absurd image, emphasizing the claustrophobia and discomfort.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Imagery:** Further reinforces the chaotic and claustrophobic scene.
        *   **Hyperbole:** Exaggerates the closeness of the men.

*   **"Here one being thronged bears back, all boll‚Äôn and red;"**
    *   *Meaning:* Describes another individual being pushed back by the crowd, his face swollen ("boll'n") and flushed ("red") from the pressure and exertion. He's struggling against the force.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Imagery:** The words "boll'n and red" vividly portray the physical effects of the crush, emphasizing the men's distress.
        *   **Alliteration:** The repetition of the 'b' sound in "being," "bears," and "boll'n" subtly reinforces the idea of struggle and burden.

*   **"Another smothered seems to pelt and swear;"**
    *   *Meaning:* Another person is being suffocated by the crowd and is reacting by striking out ("pelt") and cursing ("swear"). He's trying to fight his way out of the suffocating press.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Imagery:** The word "smothered" evokes a powerful sense of panic and desperation.
        *   **Onomatopoeia:** The word "pelt" is partially onomatopoeic, suggesting the sound of hitting or struggling.

*   **"And in their rage such signs of rage they bear"**
    *   *Meaning:* Reinforces the idea that the people in the crowd are exhibiting clear signs of their anger and frustration. The repetition of "rage" emphasizes the intensity of their emotions.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Repetition:** Emphasizes the overwhelming feeling of rage.

*   **"As, but for loss of Nestor‚Äôs golden words,"**
    *   *Meaning:* Introduces a hypothetical contrast. "Nestor" is a reference to the wise old counselor from Homer's *Iliad*. The line suggests that if they didn't lack Nestor's persuasive and calming eloquence (his "golden words"),...
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Allusion:** Refers to a figure known for his wisdom and ability to calm tempers.
        *   **Metaphor:** "Golden words" is a metaphor for eloquent and persuasive speech.

*   **"It seemed they would debate with angry swords."**
    *   *Meaning:* ...then these men would have already resorted to violence. The chaos and fury are so intense that the only thing preventing a full-blown brawl is the absence of someone capable of reasoned discourse.
    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Synecdoche:** "Swords" stands in for armed conflict or violence.

**Overall Meaning of the Stanza:**

The stanza depicts a scene of intense chaos and rising tension within a crowd. The physical discomfort, claustrophobia, and frustration have brought the men to the brink of violence. The allusion to Nestor highlights the importance of reason and eloquence in preventing conflict.  Without a voice of reason to calm them, the men are ready to explode into a literal sword fight.

**Key Themes and Observations:**

*   **The Destructive Power of Uncontrolled Emotion:** The stanza illustrates how pent-up frustration and rage can quickly escalate into violence.
*   **The Importance of Reason and Diplomacy:** The allusion to Nestor emphasizes the need for wise counsel and persuasive communication to prevent conflict.
*   **The Physicality of Emotion:** The stanza vividly portrays how emotional states manifest in physical ways (flushed faces, jostling, being smothered).
*   **Foreshadowing:** Given the context of *The Rape of Lucrece*, this stanza can be seen as foreshadowing the larger conflict and violence that will erupt as a result of Tarquin's actions. It suggests the breakdown of social order and the potential for widespread chaos.
