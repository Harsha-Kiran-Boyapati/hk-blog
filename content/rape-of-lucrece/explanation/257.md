## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Let's break down this stanza from Shakespeare's "The Rape of Lucrece" step-by-step:

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"The one doth call her his, the other his,"**
    *   **"The one":** Refers to Tarquin, the rapist.
    *   **"The other":** Refers to Collatine, Lucrece's husband.
    *   **"doth call her his":** Both men are claiming ownership of Lucrece. The archaic "doth" is a Shakespearean way of saying "does."
    *   **Meaning:** Both Tarquin and Collatine are, in different ways, claiming Lucrece as their own. Tarquin has done this with the act of violence and Collatine by virtue of marriage.

*   **"Yet neither may possess the claim they lay,"**
    *   **"Yet":** Introduces a contrast or contradiction.
    *   **"neither may possess":** Neither can actually have the claim they are making. Tarquin cannot *own* Lucrece because his "possession" was a violation, and Collatine's claim is now marred by the event.
    *   **"the claim they lay":** The claims they are making, of possession or ownership.
    *   **Meaning:** Despite claiming her, neither man can truly possess Lucrece. Tarquin cannot have her in a legitimate way (the rape leaves the claim null and void), and Collatine's possession is tainted by the violation. This highlights the tragedy of the situation, where the act has destroyed the concept of rightful ownership.

*   **"The father says ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs mine.‚Äù ‚ÄúO, mine she is,‚Äù"**
    *   **"The father":** Refers to Lucrece's father. This line highlights the grief of all those who loved Lucrece.
    *   **"says 'She's mine'":** He is claiming her to belong to him by blood/inheritance.
    *   **"O, mine she is,‚Äù**: Is Collatine's immediate response.
    *   **Meaning:** The father (or the family, in general) mourns for her as she is part of them, and the father feels a sense of ownership. Collatine responds by reinforcing his claim to her through marriage.

*   **"Replies her husband. ‚ÄúDo not take away"**
    *   **"Replies her husband":** Collatine is speaking.
    *   **"Do not take away":** Emphasizes the possessive nature of Collatine's sorrow.
    *   **Meaning:** Collatine responds to the father by reiterating his claim and imploring others not to lessen the pain of his loss and that of ownership.

*   **"My sorrow‚Äôs interest; let no mourner say"**
    *   **"My sorrow‚Äôs interest":** A complex phrase. "Interest" here means a stake or share. Collatine feels that his sorrow is his exclusive right, as it results from his loss. He is "investing" or claiming ownership of this grief.
    *   **"let no mourner say":** He doesn't want anyone else to claim similar grief.
    *   **Meaning:** Collatine demands to be the exclusive owner of the grief caused by Lucrece's death. He doesn't want others to share in the mourning.

*   **"He weeps for her, for she was only mine,"**
    *   **"He weeps for her":** Refers to any other mourner.
    *   **"she was only mine":** Reinforces the idea of exclusive possession.
    *   **Meaning:** Collatine claims that other mourners' grief is less important, as she "only" belonged to him, solidifying the concept of the exclusive claim.

*   **"And only must be wailed by Collatine.‚Äù**
    *   **"And only must be wailed by Collatine":** Emphasizes the finality of his claim. The implication is that no one's grief is as valid.
    *   **Meaning:** Collatine concludes by insisting that only he has the right to mourn and wail for Lucrece.

**Literary Devices:**

*   **Repetition:** The repetition of "mine" and the possessive claims throughout the stanza underscores the central theme of ownership and loss.
*   **Irony:** The irony lies in the fact that Collatine's claim of ownership is being made *after* the violation. His claim rings hollow after the rape, highlighting the tragedy.
*   **Metaphor/Personification:** The stanza personifies sorrow as something that can be "claimed" and possess "interest." This emphasizes how he is claiming the pain as well as Lucrece.
*   **Climax:** The ending of the stanza is the climax of Collatine's claims, as he insists that only he can mourn.

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza encapsulates the devastating consequences of the rape of Lucrece. It reveals the breakdown of order and the utter destruction of the traditional concept of ownership, as it is no longer based on proper conduct. It shows the raw grief and possessiveness of the people who were close to Lucrece, while also highlighting their confusion. Collatine, in his grief, tries to lay exclusive claim to her memory and the pain caused by her death. It is an attempt to regain some semblance of control in a situation that has stripped him of all power. The stanza's focus on the possessive "mine" reinforces the destructive nature of the violation and highlights the tragedy of the situation. It is important to note that Shakespeare is also portraying the idea of grief as a very personal and intimate experience.
