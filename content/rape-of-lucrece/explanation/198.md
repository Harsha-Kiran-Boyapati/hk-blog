# Stanza 198 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
There might you see the labouring pioneer
Begrimed with sweat and smeared all with dust;
And from the towers of Troy there would appear
The very eyes of men through loop-holes thrust,
Gazing upon the Greeks with little lust.
Such sweet observance in this work was had,
That one might see those far-off eyes look sad.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down this stanza from Shakespeare's 'The Rape of Lucrece' piece by piece and then put it all together.

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **Line 1: "There might you see the labouring pioneer"**

    *   *Meaning:* "There" refers to the imagined scene of the Trojan War. "Pioneer" here means a soldier who is doing the hard, often dangerous, work of digging trenches, building fortifications, or clearing paths.  The phrase "labouring pioneer" emphasizes the strenuous effort involved.
    *   *Literary Devices:* Imagery (visual - the image of a working soldier)

*   **Line 2: "Begrimed with sweat and smeared all with dust;"**

    *   *Meaning:* This line elaborates on the condition of the "pioneer" described in the previous line. "Begrimed" and "smeared" both mean dirtied/covered in something, emphasizing the harsh conditions of war. The use of "sweat" and "dust" is not only descriptive but evokes a sense of exertion and the environment of a siege.
    *   *Literary Devices:* Imagery (tactile/visual - you can almost feel the dirt and sweat). Alliteration (repetition of the "s" sound in "sweat" and "smeared").

*   **Line 3: "And from the towers of Troy there would appear"**

    *   *Meaning:* The perspective shifts. We're now looking at the defenders of Troy, specifically those positioned in the high towers of the city. The phrase "there would appear" suggests a possible scenario rather than a certainty; a conditional mood.
    *   *Literary Devices:* Imagery (visual - the towers of a city).

*   **Line 4: "The very eyes of men through loop-holes thrust,"**

    *   *Meaning:* This gives us a more detailed view of the defenders. "Loop-holes" are the small openings in castle walls or towers, used for observation and defense. The phrase "very eyes of men" is a synecdoche, where "eyes" represent the men themselves (a part representing the whole).  "Thrust" indicates the urgency and intensity of their vigilance.
    *   *Literary Devices:* Imagery (visual - close-up of eyes peering through a hole). Synecdoche (eyes representing men).

*   **Line 5: "Gazing upon the Greeks with little lust."**

    *   *Meaning:* "Lust" here is not sexual desire, but rather eagerness, excitement, or enjoyment. The Trojans are watching the Greeks, but without enthusiasm. They are not enjoying this situation at all. The line implies fear, dread, or weariness.
    *   *Literary Devices:* Irony (because "lust" commonly refers to passion)

*   **Line 6: "Such sweet observance in this work was had,"**

    *   *Meaning:* "Observance" means "attention" or "watching". "Sweet" is used ironically; there is nothing sweet about the horrors of war. The line acts as a bridge between the scene and the emotional state of the viewers. The word "work" refers to the grim business of siege and war.
    *   *Literary Devices:* Irony (the juxtaposition of "sweet" with the context of war).

*   **Line 7: "That one might see those far-off eyes look sad."**

    *   *Meaning:* This line emphasizes the emotional impact of the war. The "far-off eyes" (from the Trojans in the towers) look sad. The stanza culminates in portraying the grief, despair, and trauma of war on both sides.
    *   *Literary Devices:* Imagery (visual/emotional - the image of sad eyes).

**Overall Meaning of the Stanza:**

This stanza offers a glimpse into the grim reality of the Trojan War. It depicts the harsh labor of the soldiers on the ground and the weary, apprehensive vigilance of the Trojan defenders in the towers. The overarching theme is the lack of glory or excitement in war; instead, there is only hard work, fear, and sadness. Shakespeare uses the image of sad eyes to convey the emotional toll that war takes on those involved, painting a picture of shared suffering and despair on both sides of the conflict. It's a humanizing moment in the midst of a grand, legendary battle. The use of irony and juxtaposition contributes to this sense of the grim, unromantic reality of war. The stanza suggests that the Trojans (like Lucrece later) are victims caught in a situation not of their own making, inspiring sympathy in the reader.
