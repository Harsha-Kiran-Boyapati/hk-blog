# Stanza 91 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
'Think but how vile a spectacle it were,
To view thy present trespass in another.
Men's faults do seldom to themselves appear;
Their own transgressions partially they smother:
This guilt would seem death-worthy in thy brother.
O, how are they wrapp'd in with infamies
That from their own misdeeds askance their eyes!
```

**Overall Meaning of the Stanza:**

This stanza is a complex and insightful exploration of hypocrisy and self-deception. The speaker (presumably Lucrece, or perhaps the narrative voice) is trying to appeal to Tarquin's conscience by making him confront the ugliness of his intended act. The stanza argues that people are often blind to their own faults, minimizing or ignoring their transgressions while readily condemning the same actions in others. The vivid imagery of "smothering" transgressions and looking "askance" at misdeeds conveys the sense of shame and guilt that people try to avoid. Ultimately, the stanza condemns the self-serving blindness that allows people to commit atrocities while justifying them to themselves.
