# Stanza 89 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
'And wilt thou be the school where Lust shall learn?
Must he in thee read lectures of such shame?
Wilt thou be glass wherein it shall discern
Authority for sin, warrant for blame,
To privilege dishonour in thy name?
Thou black'st reproach against long-living laud,
And makest fair reputation but a bawd.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down this powerful stanza from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* line by line and then discuss the overall meaning and literary devices:

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"And wilt thou be the school where Lust shall learn?"**
    *   **Meaning:** Are you going to become the place where lust can learn and be educated?
    *   **Analysis:** This is a rhetorical question directed at Lucrece herself.  It uses **metaphor** -  Lucrece is being compared to a school, a place of instruction.  The verb "wilt" suggests a questioning of Lucrece's will or choice, although she is a victim of forced sexual assault.

*   **"Must he in thee read lectures of such shame?"**
    *   **Meaning:** Will lust be able to find lessons and examples of such deep shame within you?
    *   **Analysis:** Again, a rhetorical question. "He" refers to lust, personified as a student.  The idea is that Lucrece's rape will provide justification or excuses for lust to commit further violations. Another **metaphor** with "lectures" connecting to the idea of school from the previous line.

*   **"Wilt thou be glass wherein it shall discern"**
    *   **Meaning:** Will you become a mirror in which lust sees?
    *   **Analysis:** "It" continues to refer to "Lust."  Another rhetorical question. Here, Lucrece is cast as a mirror reflecting back an image of "authority for sin," suggesting that her situation might be twisted to give permission for further transgressions. The mirror metaphor implies a distorted reflection or perspective.

*   **"Authority for sin, warrant for blame,"**
    *   **Meaning:** Will you provide permission for sinful acts and justification for others to be blamed?
    *   **Analysis:** This line clarifies what Lust might "discern" or see in Lucrece. The "authority" and "warrant" suggests that the act can be repeated, as Lucrece's experience legitimizes "blame" for another.

*   **"To privilege dishonour in thy name?"**
    *   **Meaning:** Will you make dishonor esteemed or given special status through your own name/reputation?
    *   **Analysis:** Another rhetorical question that builds on the previous lines. It's suggesting that Lucrece's good name will be tarnished and that dishonor will gain power through association with her.

*   **"Thou black'st reproach against long-living laud,"**
    *   **Meaning:** You are staining (blackening) the memory of virtuous things that were once highly respected.
    *   **Analysis:** "Long-living laud" refers to things that are traditionally praised. "Black'st" is a verb made from the adjective. The line suggests that this one act will damage all past acts of integrity, so to speak. This is an example of **imagery** of light and darkness.

*   **"And makest fair reputation but a bawd."**
    *   **Meaning:** And you turn a good reputation into something that encourages depravity.
    *   **Analysis:** This is a powerful and damning statement. A "bawd" is someone who manages or profits from prostitution. The line suggests that Lucrece's once-pristine reputation will now be used to facilitate or excuse further immoral behavior. It ends the stanza on a devastating note, highlighting the corrupting influence of the rape. **Metaphor**: reputation compared to a bawd.

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza is a blistering condemnation of the potential consequences of the rape of Lucrece. It argues that her suffering could inadvertently embolden lust and sin, providing it with a justification and even a sense of authority. The stanza suggests that her violated purity will be twisted to excuse further acts of dishonor, ultimately corrupting not only her reputation but also the very concept of virtue itself. The speaker is essentially saying that Lucrece's tragedy could become a license for future transgressions, turning her into an unwilling "school" for lust and transforming her good name into a facilitator of vice. The speaker is making an impassioned plea (albeit indirectly) to Lucrece to consider the potential ramifications of her situation and to act in a way that preserves virtue, even in the face of unspeakable trauma.

**Literary Devices:**

*   **Rhetorical Questions:** The repeated use of "wilt thou" and "must he" emphasizes the gravity of the situation and forces the audience to confront the potential consequences of Lucrece's rape.
*   **Metaphor:** Lucrece is compared to a "school," a "glass," and ultimately, her reputation is likened to a "bawd." These metaphors highlight the way her virtue could be corrupted and exploited.
*   **Personification:** Lust is personified as "he," further emphasizing its active and destructive nature.
*   **Imagery:** The phrase "black'st reproach" creates a strong visual image of defilement and corruption.
*   **Alliteration:** While not abundant, there is some subtle alliteration, such as "long-living laud," which enhances the musicality of the language.
*   **Juxtaposition:** The stark contrast between "fair reputation" and "bawd" underscores the devastating transformation that Lucrece's rape threatens to bring about.

The stanza is a masterclass in persuasive rhetoric, using a combination of vivid imagery, powerful metaphors, and carefully crafted questions to convey the profound ethical and social implications of Lucrece's tragedy.
