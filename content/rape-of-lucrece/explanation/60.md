# Stanza 60 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
What could he see but mightily he noted?
What did he note but strongly he desired?
What he beheld, on that he firmly doted,
And in his will his wilful eye he tired.
With more than admiration he admired
Her azure veins, her alabaster skin,
Her coral lips, her snow-white dimpled chin.
```

**Overall Meaning:**

Stanza 60 is a powerful depiction of Tarquin's escalating lust and his objectification of Lucrece. It traces the progression of his desire from simple observation to an overwhelming, almost obsessive fixation. The stanza highlights that his actions are not simply based on natural attraction but are fueled by a deliberate and forceful act of will. He is intentionally indulging in and feeding his lust. The meticulous detailing of Lucrece's physical attributes serves to dehumanize her, reducing her to a collection of beautiful, yet ultimately vulnerable, features. The contrasting imagery of purity and implied violation creates a sense of foreboding and sets the stage for the tragic events to follow. The stanza emphasizes the moral corruption and the active, conscious decision-making involved in Tarquin's villainy.
