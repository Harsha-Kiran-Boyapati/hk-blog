# Stanza 57 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
Without the bed her other fair hand was,
On the green coverlet; whose perfect white
Show'd like an April daisy on the grass,
With pearly sweat, resembling dew of night.
Her eyes, like marigolds, had sheathed their light,
And canopied in darkness sweetly lay,
Till they might open to adorn the day.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"Without the bed her other fair hand was,"**

    *   **Meaning:** This line simply states that one of Lucrece's beautiful hands was outside the bed, resting on the bed covering. The use of "without" can also imply this hand is now lifeless or disconnected from her.
    *   **Literary Devices:**  *Inversion* (the normal word order would be "Her other fair hand was without the bed"). This stylistic choice emphasizes the location of her hand and draws immediate attention to her vulnerability. It is the placement of her hand that is important, not her hand itself.

*   **"On the green coverlet; whose perfect white"**

    *   **Meaning:** Her hand rested on the green bed covering, which was pristine white. This sets up a visual contrast and highlights the purity that is about to be violated.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Color Symbolism* Green often symbolizes nature and life, while white represents purity and innocence. The use of both colors sets up a contrast that is symbolic of her innocence in a world dominated by sin.

*   **"Show'd like an April daisy on the grass,"**

    *   **Meaning:** The white of her hand on the green coverlet resembled a daisy on green grass. This is a simile creating a vivid and delicate image.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Simile* (using "like" for comparison). *Imagery* evokes a sense of natural beauty and fragility, as daisies are small and easily crushed. *Pastoral Imagery* This idyllic image is about to be marred, which emphasizes the tragedy of the event.

*   **"With pearly sweat, resembling dew of night."**

    *   **Meaning:** The sweat on her hand shone like pearls, looking like the morning dew. This adds another layer of delicate imagery and suggests that she is either sleeping peacefully, or more likely, that the sweat is from the stress and trauma she has just experienced, but still has the look of beauty.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Simile* (using "resembling" for comparison). *Imagery* The pearly sweat conjures an image of refinement and beauty, even in a state of distress. *Metaphor* "Pearly sweat" is a subtle metaphor, comparing the sweat to precious pearls.

*   **"Her eyes, like marigolds, had sheathed their light,"**

    *   **Meaning:** Her eyes, which are compared to bright marigolds, were closed. This describes the closed eyes, suggesting sleep or unconsciousness.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Simile* (using "like" for comparison). *Metaphor* (eyes and light). *Imagery* Marigolds are associated with the sun, suggesting that her eyes are usually radiant and full of life.

*   **"And canopied in darkness sweetly lay,"**

    *   **Meaning:** Her eyes were covered by her eyelids, lying peacefully in darkness. This further emphasizes the closed eyes and suggests a state of rest or unknowing.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Metaphor* "Canopied in darkness" uses "canopied" as a verb, suggesting that her eyelids are like a canopy or covering, sheltering her eyes from the light. *Alliteration* (canopied, darkness). The soft "c" and "d" sounds contribute to the tranquil tone.

*   **"Till they might open to adorn the day."**

    *   **Meaning:** This suggests that her eyes will eventually open and brighten the day, as if her eyes are a source of light and beauty for the world. There's a hint of hope and potential, even in this tragic situation.
    *   **Literary Devices:** *Personification* (eyes "adorn the day"). This endows her eyes with the power to enhance the world. *Foreshadowing* There is a sense of impending doom. She will open her eyes, but when she does it won't be to greet the day in a pleasant way.

**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza paints a picture of Lucrece in a state of post-assault stillness. She appears to be asleep, but the "pearly sweat" hints at the trauma she has endured. The imagery emphasizes her beauty, purity, and vulnerability, heightening the tragedy of her situation. The initial image is delicate and beautiful, using pastoral and natural imagery, but is marred by the realization that this beauty has been violated. There is a sense of false peace or respite before the inevitable awakening to the full horror of what has happened. The stanza emphasizes the contrast between her outward beauty and the internal pain she is experiencing.
