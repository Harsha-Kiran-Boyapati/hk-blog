# Stanza 7 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
But some untimely thought did instigate
His all-too-timeless speed, if none of those:
His honour, his affairs, his friends, his state,
Neglected all, with swift intent he goes
To quench the coal which in his liver glows.
O rash false heat, wrapp'd in repentant cold,
Thy hasty spring still blasts, and ne'er grows old!
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
This stanza from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* focuses on Tarquin's sudden and reckless pursuit of Lucrece, exploring the internal conflict and consequences of his actions. Let's break it down line by line:

* **"But some untimely thought did instigate / His all-too-timeless speed, if none of those:"** This opens with a contrast.  "Some untimely thought" suggests a sudden, inappropriate impulse, a desire that overrides reason and proper conduct. "Instigate" implies a forceful, almost demonic prompting.  "His all-too-timeless speed" is a paradoxical phrase; his haste is excessive and ill-timed, ignoring the usual considerations of time and decorum.  The "if none of those" suggests that even if we dismiss more obvious explanations (like duty or business), something deeply inappropriate drove him. This line uses **antithesis** (contrast between "untimely" and "timeless") and **paradox** ("all-too-timeless speed").


* **"His honour, his affairs, his friends, his state, / Neglected all, with swift intent he goes"**: This line lists the things Tarquin is neglecting in his frantic rush ‚Äì his reputation, his responsibilities, his relationships, and his social standing.  This is a form of **anaphora**, with the repetition of "his" emphasizing the complete disregard for his life's essentials.  The use of a series highlights the scope of his negligence.


* **"To quench the coal which in his liver glows."**:  This is a metaphor. In Elizabethan physiology, the liver was associated with lust and passion.  "Coal" represents the burning intensity of Tarquin's desire, a fire that consumes him. This is **metaphorical language** used to show the consuming nature of his lust.


* **"O rash false heat, wrapp'd in repentant cold, / Thy hasty spring still blasts, and ne'er grows old!"**: This is an apostrophe, a direct address to Tarquin's lust. "Rash false heat" personifies his passion, describing it as both reckless and deceptive. "Wrapp'd in repentant cold" is another paradox:  it suggests that even amidst the heat of his actions, the seeds of regret and future suffering already exist. "Thy hasty spring still blasts, and ne'er grows old!" uses imagery of a premature spring that is immediately destroyed by frost; it's a metaphor for the destructive and eternally self-defeating nature of Tarquin's impulsive, lustful behavior.  The "ne'er grows old" emphasizes the enduring consequences of his rash actions.  This line uses **personification** (giving human qualities to "heat") and **imagery** (of spring and frost).


**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza portrays Tarquin's impulsive act as driven by an internal force he cannot control, a "rash false heat."  It highlights the destructive nature of uncontrolled lust and its immediate and long-lasting consequences. Shakespeare uses paradox, metaphor, and personification to emphasize the destructive nature of Tarquin's passion, foreshadowing the tragic events to come. His reckless disregard for his obligations foreshadows his moral collapse and the devastating consequences that follow his rape of Lucrece. The stanza's imagery foreshadows the destructive nature of Tarquin's lust and suggests that it is a force that will continue to torment him.
