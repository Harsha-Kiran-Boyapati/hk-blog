# Stanza 140 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
'Disturb his hours of rest with restless trances,
Afflict him in his bed with bedrid groans;
Let there bechance him pitiful mischances,
To make him moan; but pity not his moans:
Stone him with harden'd hearts harder than stones;
And let mild women to him lose their mildness,
Wilder to him than tigers in their wildness.
```

    *   **Meaning:**  She hopes that Tarquin's sleep will be plagued by disturbing, unsettled visions or nightmares.  He won't find peace even in his sleep.

*   **"Let there bechance him pitiful mischances,"**
    *   **Meaning:**  She desires that unfortunate and regrettable events should occur to him.  "Mischances" here means accidents, calamities, or misfortunes. The word "pitiful" is ironic as she will later show no pity.

**Overall Meaning of the Stanza:**

This stanza is a powerful expression of Lucrece's intense anger and desire for revenge.  She is not merely seeking justice; she wants Tarquin to suffer immensely, both physically and emotionally.  She calls for universal condemnation and a complete reversal of expected behaviors.  Even the most compassionate people should turn against him with a ferocity that is almost inhuman.  The stanza emphasizes the depth of her pain and the shattering of her innocence and trust.  It highlights the transformative power of trauma, as she imagines even the mildest of women becoming vengeful figures.  The repetition and use of extreme language (hyperbole) contribute to the stanza's forceful and emotionally charged atmosphere. It's a visceral representation of the destructive power of rape and the consuming desire for retribution. It shows the depths of despair and anger Lucrece feels, not only for herself but for all womankind.
