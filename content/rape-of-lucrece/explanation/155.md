# Stanza 155 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
By this, lamenting Philomel had ended
The well-tuned warble of her nightly sorrow,
And solemn night with slow sad gait descended
To ugly hell; when, lo, the blushing morrow
Lends light to all fair eyes that light will borrow:
But cloudy Lucrece shames herself to see,
And therefore still in night would cloister'd be.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down Stanza 155 of Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* line by line, identifying the key elements and then putting it all together to understand the overall meaning.

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"By this, lamenting Philomel had ended"**:
    *   *Meaning*: "By this time," (meaning around now) the mythic nightingale, Philomel (who was raped and had her tongue cut out, hence her "lamenting"), had finished singing.
    *   *Literary Devices*:
        *   **Allusion**: To the myth of Philomela. This immediately establishes a connection between Lucrece and another woman who suffered a brutal sexual assault. This comparison sets the tone for Lucrece's reaction.

*   **"The well-tuned warble of her nightly sorrow,"**:
    *   *Meaning*: The nightingale's beautiful, melodious song, expressing her deep grief, had stopped for the night.
    *   *Literary Devices*:
        *   **Imagery**: The words "well-tuned warble" create a vivid auditory image of the bird's song.
        *   **Personification**: Sorrow is personified as something that can be expressed through a song.
        *   **Alliteration**: The repetition of the 'w' sound in "well-tuned warble" adds to the musicality of the line.

*   **"And solemn night with slow sad gait descended"**:
    *   *Meaning*: Night, personified as a somber figure, slowly moved toward hell.
    *   *Literary Devices*:
        *   **Personification**: Night is given human qualities ("solemn," "sad," "gait").
        *   **Imagery**: The "slow sad gait" creates a visual image of the night dragging itself away, emphasizing the darkness and depression of the scene.
        *   **Metaphor**: Suggests that night is essentially a journey to hell, reinforcing the idea that the night of the rape was a descent into a dark, horrible experience.

*   **"To ugly hell; when, lo, the blushing morrow"**:
    *   *Meaning*: Night left for hell, and then, surprisingly, the "blushing morrow" (morning) arrives.
    *   *Literary Devices*:
        *   **Personification**: "Blushing morrow" personifies morning, giving it the human action of blushing.
        *   **Contrast**: The arrival of the "blushing morrow" creates a stark contrast with the "solemn night" and "ugly hell." The innocence of morning is juxtaposed with the horror of the previous night.
        *   **Interjection**: "Lo" is an archaic interjection, emphasizing the surprise and suddenness of the morning's arrival.

*   **"Lends light to all fair eyes that light will borrow:"**:
    *   *Meaning*: Morning gives its light to all eyes that are willing to receive it.
    *   *Literary Devices*:
        *   **Personification**: Light is personified as something that can be lent.
        *   **Metaphor**: "Borrow" suggests that eyes are dependent on morning for light.

*   **"But cloudy Lucrece shames herself to see,"**:
    *   *Meaning*: But Lucrece, whose mind is "cloudy" with sorrow and shame, feels too ashamed to look at the light of day.
    *   *Literary Devices*:
        *   **Metaphor**: Lucrece's mind is "cloudy," suggesting confusion, sorrow, and a lack of clarity.
        *   **Contrast**: This line contrasts Lucrece with the "fair eyes" in the previous line. She is no longer "fair" because of what has happened to her.
        *   **Allusion**: Echoing the theme of shame and dishonour.

*   **"And therefore still in night would cloister'd be."**:
    *   *Meaning*: And therefore, she wants to remain hidden in darkness.
    *   *Literary Devices*:
        *   **Imagery**: "Cloister'd be" creates an image of Lucrece enclosed and isolated, like a nun in a convent, seeking refuge from the world.
        *   **Symbolism**: Night symbolizes the darkness of her trauma, her shame, and her desire to hide from the world.

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza sets the stage for Lucrece's struggle with the aftermath of her rape. The contrast between the emerging morning and Lucrece's desire to remain in darkness highlights the psychological impact of the assault. While the world moves on, bathed in the light of a new day, Lucrece is trapped in the darkness of her trauma and shame. The allusions to Philomela, the use of personification, and the vivid imagery all contribute to a powerful portrayal of Lucrece's internal state. She is fundamentally altered by the violation and can no longer face the world. The stanza emphasizes Lucrece's alienation and her desire to withdraw from the world, foreshadowing her tragic fate. She feels tainted and unable to participate in the restorative power of the new day. This highlights the social and psychological consequences of sexual violence.
