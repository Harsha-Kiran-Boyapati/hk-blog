# Stanza 188 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
Here folds she up the tenor of her woe,
Her certain sorrow writ uncertainly.
By this short schedule Collatine may know
Her grief, but not her grief‚Äôs true quality;
She dares not thereof make discovery,
Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse,
Ere she with blood had stained her stained excuse.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down Stanza 188 of Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* line by line and then discuss the overall meaning and literary devices.

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"Here folds she up the tenor of her woe,"**
    *   *Breakdown:* "Here" indicates location, which in this case is a letter Lucrece has written to Collatine. "Folds she up" means she is folding something (the letter). "Tenor of her woe" refers to the main point, the substance, or the underlying meaning of her suffering. So, Lucrece is folding up the letter that contains the essence of her sorrow.
    *   *Meaning:* She finishes writing the letter conveying the core of her grief.
*   **"Her certain sorrow writ uncertainly."**
    *   *Breakdown:* "Certain sorrow" means that her sorrow is real and definite. "Writ uncertainly" suggests that although the sorrow is very real, the letter expresses it in a veiled, ambiguous, or unclear manner. This can happen due to a mix of her shame and fear of what Collatine will do.
    *   *Meaning:* Her true sorrow is real, but her letter doesn't express it directly. It is written in a way that keeps some secrets hidden and only gives hints about the extent of the grief.
*   **"By this short schedule Collatine may know"**
    *   *Breakdown:* "Short schedule" implies the letter is brief, or that the amount of detail provided is minimal. "Collatine may know" suggests that the letter will give Collatine *some* information.
    *   *Meaning:* From this brief message, Collatine will be able to get a basic idea of the situation.
*   **"Her grief, but not her grief‚Äôs true quality;"**
    *   *Breakdown:* "Grief" refers to her suffering. "Grief's true quality" suggests the intensity, depth, or nature of her grief. She cannot express the full horror of what she has experienced.
    *   *Meaning:* He will know she is suffering, but he won't grasp the full extent or the horrific nature of what happened to her.
*   **"She dares not thereof make discovery,"**
    *   *Breakdown:* "She dares not" emphasizes her fear. "Thereof make discovery" means she doesn't dare to fully reveal or disclose everything.
    *   *Meaning:* She does not dare to tell him everything that happened.
*   **"Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse,"**
    *   *Breakdown:* "Lest" means "for fear that." "Hold it her own gross abuse" means that she fears that Collatine will blame her for what happened, believing that she somehow provoked or consented to the rape. "Gross abuse" emphasizes the severity of the perceived blame.
    *   *Meaning:* She's afraid that Collatine will accuse her of having been complicit or responsible for the act.
*   **"Ere she with blood had stained her stained excuse."**
    *   *Breakdown:* "Ere" means "before." "With blood had stained her stained excuse" This is a complex line. "Stained excuse" refers to her reason for telling him, or her explanation (the letter itself). Her "excuse" is already stained, by the rape, and the shame of it. "With blood" refers to her anticipated suicide. So, she needs to kill herself (shed blood) to prove her innocence, and that her "excuse" is real.
    *   *Meaning:* Before she can prove her innocence, through suicide, he will accuse her. Her only way of proving that she didn't consent is by killing herself; she feels she must commit suicide to prove that the stain (of the rape) was not of her making.

**Overall Meaning:**

In this stanza, Lucrece finishes writing a letter to her husband, Collatine, to inform him of the rape. She folds the letter containing her grief. She writes of the event in a way that is unclear. Though her sorrow is real, she cannot bring herself to describe the true horror of the rape for fear that Collatine will blame her, believing that she provoked or consented to the act. She fears that, if she doesn't kill herself to prove her innocence, he will always believe her responsible. She must stain her already stained excuse, meaning her explanation for the rape, with her own blood through suicide, to prove that she was a victim and not culpable.

**Literary Devices:**

*   **Irony:** There is a strong element of situational irony. Lucrece, the victim of a violent crime, feels compelled to prove her innocence through suicide. The societal standards of the time place the burden of proof on the victim, not the perpetrator.
*   **Metaphor:** "The tenor of her woe" is a metaphor for the core meaning of her suffering. "Stained excuse" is a metaphor for her sullied reputation and the justification she must provide.
*   **Euphemism:** The language used is often euphemistic, as Shakespeare avoids directly stating the act of rape and instead uses indirect references to grief and stains.
*   **Alliteration:** The repetition of consonant sounds adds emphasis. For example, "certain sorrow," which highlights the real nature of her grief.
*   **Paradox:** "Her certain sorrow writ uncertainly" is a paradox, highlighting the contradiction between the reality of her suffering and the way she's forced to express it.
*   **Foreshadowing:** The line "Ere she with blood had stained her stained excuse" foreshadows her eventual suicide.

This stanza is powerful because it captures the complex emotions of a rape victim in a society where women were often held responsible for their own victimization. It is a dark and poignant reflection on the themes of honor, shame, and the devastating consequences of sexual violence.
