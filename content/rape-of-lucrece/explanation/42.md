# Stanza 42 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
Within his thought her heavenly image sits,
And in the self-same seat sits Collatine:
That eye which looks on her confounds his wits;
That eye which him beholds, as more divine,
Unto a view so false will not incline;
But with a pure appeal seeks to the heart,
Which once corrupted takes the worser part;
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
This stanza from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* describes Tarquin's conflicted internal state after seeing Lucrece. Let's break it down line by line:

* **"Within his thought her heavenly image sits,"**  This establishes the primary image: Lucrece's beauty is so striking that it occupies Tarquin's mind completely.  "Heavenly image" uses **metaphor** to emphasize her surpassing loveliness and purity.  The verb "sits" suggests a settled, persistent presence, not a fleeting impression.

* **"And in the self-same seat sits Collatine:"** This is crucial.  In Tarquin's mind, Lucrece's husband, Collatine, coexists with her image. This is not a peaceful coexistence, however.  The "self-same seat" highlights the direct competition for Tarquin's attention and, by implication, Lucrece's affections.  This is a powerful use of **juxtaposition**.

* **"That eye which looks on her confounds his wits;"** This refers to one aspect of Tarquin's vision: his lustful gaze towards Lucrece, which overwhelms his reason ("confounds his wits").  This is personification ‚Äì giving the "eye" the ability to act independently.

* **"That eye which him beholds, as more divine,"**  This introduces a second gaze, a more virtuous one, which recognizes Lucrece's purity ("more divine").  This is a counterpoint to the lustful gaze ‚Äì a conscience struggling against temptation.

* **"Unto a view so false will not incline;"** This virtuous gaze rejects ("will not incline") the deceptive ("false") allure of lust.  "False" refers to the falsity of Tarquin's desires in light of Lucrece's virtue.

* **"But with a pure appeal seeks to the heart,"**  This "pure appeal" is a plea from reason to the heart, a metaphor for conscience trying to persuade the will.  "Pure appeal" emphasizes the moral integrity of this part of Tarquin's consciousness.

* **"Which once corrupted takes the worser part;"** This is the tragic crux.  The heart, representing his will and emotions, is ultimately susceptible to corruption.  Once lust ("corrupted") takes over, it chooses the destructive course of action ("worser part").  This highlights the vulnerability of moral strength to powerful temptation.


**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza masterfully portrays Tarquin's internal struggle between lust and conscience.  His mind is a battlefield where the image of Lucrece and the competing impulses of desire and virtue clash.  While a part of him recognizes her virtue and the wrongfulness of his intentions, ultimately, his lustful desires prevail, foreshadowing the rape to come. The use of metaphorical "eyes" and the personification of internal conflicts effectively captures the psychological complexity of the moment. The stanza serves as a powerful illustration of the internal conflict that often precedes morally reprehensible actions.
