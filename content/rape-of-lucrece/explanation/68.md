# Stanza 68 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
First, like a trumpet, doth his tongue begin
To sound a parley to his heartless foe;
Who o'er the white sheet peers her whiter chin,
The reason of this rash alarm to know,
Which he by dumb demeanor seeks to show;
But she with vehement prayers urgeth still
Under what colour he commits this ill.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"First, like a trumpet, doth his tongue begin"**:

    *   **Meaning:** Collatine (who is about to rape Lucrece) begins to speak. His voice is likened to a trumpet.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Simile:** "like a trumpet" - a direct comparison using "like." This suggests his voice is loud, forceful, and perhaps somewhat jarring or aggressive. Trumpets were often used to signal battle or important announcements.
        *   **Inversion (Anastrophe):** The typical word order would be "His tongue doth begin, like a trumpet." The reversed order emphasizes "trumpet" and lends a more formal, poetic feel.

*   **"To sound a parley to his heartless foe;"**:

    *   **Meaning:** He is attempting to negotiate with Lucrece, whom he sees as his "heartless foe." The "parley" implies he's trying to reach an agreement or at least explain himself before proceeding. Collatine views her virtue as an obstacle.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Metaphor:** Lucrece is referred to as a "heartless foe." This isn't literal; it signifies her resistance to his advances, her moral opposition to his lust. It emphasizes his perceived battle against her virtue.
        *   **Personification:** Giving Lucrece, who is the embodiment of virtue in Collatine's mind, the characteristic of being a "foe".
        *   **Allusion:** "parley" suggests a formal discussion between enemies, reminiscent of battlefield negotiations.

*   **"Who o'er the white sheet peers her whiter chin,"**:

    *   **Meaning:** Lucrece, from beneath the bedsheets, looks up with her pale chin visible. The sheets emphasize her purity and vulnerability. The color white symbolizes innocence.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Imagery:** The visual image of Lucrece peering over the sheets is vivid. The use of "white" is symbolic and reinforces her purity.
        *   **Alliteration:** "white sheet" and "whiter chin". The repeated 'wh' sound emphasizes the purity theme.
        *   **Juxtaposition:** Comparing the whiteness of the sheets to her chin. This highlights Lucrece's beauty and, again, emphasizes her innocence, making Collatine's actions even more reprehensible.

*   **"The reason of this rash alarm to know,"**:

    *   **Meaning:** Lucrece wants to know why Collatine is acting so abruptly and aggressively. She is alarmed and demands an explanation.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **None particularly strong, but consider the slight understatement:** The word "alarm" is perhaps understated, given the gravity of the situation. It hints at her initial shock and confusion.

*   **"Which he by dumb demeanor seeks to show;"**:

    *   **Meaning:** He tries to show her, through his actions (his "dumb demeanor"), his intentions, but not verbally. He's not speaking directly about his desires.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Oxymoron (possibly):** "dumb demeanor" can be interpreted as an oxymoron. "Dumb" typically refers to a lack of speech, while "demeanor" implies behavior that communicates something. However, it can also simply mean that his behavior, rather than words, is trying to explain his intentions.

*   **"But she with vehement prayers urgeth still"**:

    *   **Meaning:** Lucrece continues to beg him earnestly, using "vehement prayers" (intense and passionate requests). She doesn't understand the non-verbal cues and wants a clear explanation.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Imagery:** "Vehement prayers" creates a strong image of Lucrece's desperation and intense pleading.
        *   **Alliteration:** "prayers urgeth" emphasizes Lucrece's pleas through the repeated "pr" sound.

*   **"Under what colour he commits this ill."**:

    *   **Meaning:** Lucrece demands to know his justification or pretense for his evil deed. "Colour" means pretext, excuse, or apparent reason. She wants to know what rationale, what twisted logic, he's using to justify his actions.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Metaphor:** "Colour" is used metaphorically to represent the apparent motive or excuse he's using to hide the true nature of his evil.
        *   **Euphemism:** "this ill" is a softer way of referring to the rape he is about to commit.

**Overall Meaning of the Stanza:**

This stanza captures the crucial moment of confrontation before the rape. Collatine attempts to initiate his assault, framing it as a negotiation ("parley") with Lucrece's virtue, which he personifies as a "heartless foe." Lucrece, awakened and alarmed, demands an explanation for his behavior. While Collatine attempts to communicate his intentions through his actions, Lucrece persists in seeking a verbal justification for what she perceives as a wrong. The stanza highlights the power imbalance, the conflicting perspectives, and the contrast between Collatine's aggressive desire and Lucrece's desperate pleas for reason and justice. The use of vivid imagery and literary devices emphasizes Lucrece's innocence, Collatine's twisted reasoning, and the imminent tragedy. Ultimately, it shows the breakdown of communication and the horrific inevitability of the act to come.
