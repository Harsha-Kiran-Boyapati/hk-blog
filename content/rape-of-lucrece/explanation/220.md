# Stanza 220 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
‚ÄúIt cannot be,‚Äù quoth she, ‚Äúthat so much guile‚Äù‚Äî
She would have said ‚Äúcan lurk in such a look.‚Äù
But Tarquin‚Äôs shape came in her mind the while,
And from her tongue ‚Äúcan lurk‚Äù from ‚Äúcannot‚Äù took.
‚ÄúIt cannot be‚Äù she in that sense forsook,
And turned it thus: ‚ÄúIt cannot be, I find,
But such a face should bear a wicked mind.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down stanza 220 of Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* line by line and then analyze the overall meaning, paying attention to literary devices:

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"It cannot be," quoth she, "that so much guile‚Äî"**:
    *   **"It cannot be"**: This is the start of Lucrece's thought process. She is resisting the idea that someone who *looks* so noble (Tarquin) could be capable of deceit.
    *   **"quoth she"**: A standard Elizabethan way of saying "said she."
    *   **"that so much guile‚Äî"**:  "Guile" means cunning, deceit, treachery. She's halting mid-sentence, about to express her disbelief that such a deceptive nature could exist. The em-dash indicates an interruption.

*   **She would have said "can lurk in such a look."**:
    *   This line reveals the original intention of Lucrece's thought. She intended to say that "guile can lurk in such a look," meaning someone who looks innocent/trustworthy could be deceiving.

*   **But Tarquin‚Äôs shape came in her mind the while,**:
    *   **"Tarquin's shape"**: Refers to the image of Tarquin, probably his physical appearance (handsome, powerful) and the impression he gives off.
    *   **"came in her mind the while"**: While she's speaking, his image floods her thoughts, disrupting her initial line of thinking. This suggests he's more insidious than she first thought, as her mind's eye is already associating Tarquin with guilt.

*   **And from her tongue "can lurk" from "cannot" took.**:
    *   This is a crucial and clever line, showing the shift in Lucrece's thinking and the power of the image of Tarquin.  Because his image has taken over her mind, the words "can lurk" come forth *from* the words she had already said, "cannot be." In other words, the image of Tarquin has literally altered the words as they left her lips.

*   **"It cannot be" she in that sense forsook,**:
    *   **"It cannot be" she in that sense forsook** She abandons the initial meaning of ‚ÄúIt cannot be,‚Äù and the line's repetition emphasizes her internal struggle. It shows she actively rejects the initial meaning. "Forsook" means abandoned or rejected.

*   **And turned it thus: ‚ÄúIt cannot be, I find,**:
    *   She re-contextualizes what she's saying, pivoting to a different conclusion.
    *   **"It cannot be, I find"**: She's still using the same initial words ("It cannot be"), but giving them a new meaning.

*   **But such a face should bear a wicked mind.**
    *   **"But such a face should bear a wicked mind"**: This is the final, transformed statement.  She's now saying: "It is inevitable that such a beautiful (or imposing, noble-seeming) face should conceal a wicked mind." She has convinced herself that Tarquin's appearance is merely a mask for his evil intentions.

**Overall Meaning and Literary Devices:**

This stanza encapsulates the crucial shift in Lucrece's perception of Tarquin. She begins with a naive (or hopeful) resistance to believing that someone who *looks* good could be evil. But the vivid image of Tarquin overwhelms her, and the very words she utters are altered by his influence. She ultimately accepts that his outward appearance is a deceptive facade for a wicked heart.

Here are some key literary devices at play:

*   **Apostrophe:** The stanza is addressed to the reader, allowing a more immediate understanding of Lucrece's thoughts.
*   **Repetition:** The repeated "It cannot be" highlights the internal conflict and the dramatic change in meaning.
*   **Internal Conflict:** The entire stanza is a representation of Lucrece's internal struggle. She grapples with her initial disbelief and her growing realization of Tarquin's capacity for evil.
*   **Imagery:** The "shape" of Tarquin, which disrupts her train of thought, is powerful visual imagery.
*   **Wordplay/Pun:** The line "And from her tongue 'can lurk' from 'cannot' took" is a clever play on words.  The phrase "can lurk" is literally extracted from the word "cannot," mirroring the extraction of her innocence and peace of mind by Tarquin.
*   **Irony:** The fact that she starts by denying the possibility of guile in a handsome face, but ends by accepting it, is deeply ironic, especially given the tragic events to come.
*   **Foreshadowing:** The shift in her perception foreshadows the tragic events of the poem, hinting that Tarquin's evil nature will be revealed. It's a moment of dramatic irony, as the reader already knows what Tarquin is capable of.

In essence, this stanza is a masterclass in Shakespeare's ability to portray psychological complexity. It shows how quickly a person's perception can be altered and how appearances can be deceiving. It highlights the corrupting influence of Tarquin and the tragic fate awaiting Lucrece.
