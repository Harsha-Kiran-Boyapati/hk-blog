# Stanza 28 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
'Fair torch, burn out thy light, and lend it not
To darken her whose light excelleth thine:
And die, unhallow'd thoughts, before you blot
With your uncleanness that which is divine;
Offer pure incense to so pure a shrine:
Let fair humanity abhor the deed
That spots and stains love's modest snow-white weed.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
This stanza from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* marks a turning point, shifting from the act of rape itself to a plea for purity and the condemnation of lust. Let's break it down line by line:

* **"Fair torch, burn out thy light, and lend it not / To darken her whose light excelleth thine:"**  This addresses the sun (the "fair torch").  The imagery suggests that the sun's light, representing beauty and virtue, should not illuminate Lucrece, whose inner light surpasses the sun's.  This is a **hyperbole** (exaggeration), emphasizing Lucrece's exceptional purity.  The implication is that the sun's light, if it shines on Lucrece after the rape, would somehow diminish her.

* **"And die, unhallow'd thoughts, before you blot / With your uncleanness that which is divine;"**  This is a direct command to lustful thoughts to cease. "Unhallowed thoughts" represent Tarquin's desires.  The phrase "that which is divine" refers to Lucrece's virtue and purity, presented as something sacred and almost godly.  The verb "blot" visually reinforces the idea of staining or corrupting something pure.

* **"Offer pure incense to so pure a shrine:"** This line continues the religious imagery, comparing Lucrece to a sacred shrine.  The "pure incense" represents the proper reverence and respect that should be shown to her.  This is a **metaphor**, linking Lucrece's purity to religious devotion.

* **"Let fair humanity abhor the deed / That spots and stains love's modest snow-white weed."** This is a general plea to humankind ("fair humanity") to condemn Tarquin's act.  The phrase "love's modest snow-white weed" is another **metaphor**, describing Lucrece's chastity as a pure white flower (a "weed" here is used in the older sense meaning a plant, not a troublesome one).  The verbs "spots" and "stains" reiterate the defilement caused by the rape.


**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza serves as a powerful condemnation of Tarquin's actions and a celebration of Lucrece's virtue.  Shakespeare uses vibrant imagery of light and darkness, purity and defilement, sacred and profane, to highlight the contrast between the rapist and the victim. The poem's speaker urges the extinguishing of lustful thoughts and a profound respect for Lucrece's moral purity, which is elevated to a near-divine status. The stanza acts as a moral interlude, emphasizing the gravity of the crime before delving into its consequences.  It‚Äôs a call for justice and a lament for the violated innocence.
