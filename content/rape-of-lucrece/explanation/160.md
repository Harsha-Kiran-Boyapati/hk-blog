# Stanza 160 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
'Tis double death to drown in ken of shore;
He ten times pines that pines beholding food;
To see the salve doth make the wound ache more;
Great grief grieves most at that would do it good;
Deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood,
Who being stopp'd, the bounding banks o'erflows;
Grief dallied with nor law nor limit knows.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down stanza 160 from Shakespeare's "The Rape of Lucrece" line by line, identifying literary devices and then piecing together the overall meaning:

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"‚ÄôTis double death to drown in ken of shore;"**

    *   **Meaning:** It's a double, or far worse, death to drown when land (safety, help) is visible and nearby.  The tragedy is compounded because rescue seems possible but is unattainable.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Hyperbole:** Exaggeration ("double death") to emphasize the agonizing nature of the situation.
        *   **Paradox:** There is an inherent contradiction. Drowning near land should be easier to prevent.

*   **"He ten times pines that pines beholding food;"**

    *   **Meaning:** A person starving suffers much more when they can see food but are unable to reach or consume it.  The presence of the solution intensifies the suffering.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Hyperbole:** "Ten times pines" exaggerates the increased suffering.
        *   **Analogy/Parallelism:** Mirrors the previous line; the starving person is to the person drowning near land.

*   **"To see the salve doth make the wound ache more;"**

    *   **Meaning:**  Seeing the ointment or medicine that could heal a wound actually makes the pain of the wound feel even sharper. Again, the nearness of relief accentuates the pain of the affliction.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Metaphor:** "Salve" stands in for any form of relief or cure.
        *   **Analogy/Parallelism:** Continuing the pattern; seeing relief intensifies suffering.

*   **"Great grief grieves most at that would do it good;"**

    *   **Meaning:**  Intense sorrow/suffering feels most intensely when it is in proximity of the thing that would alleviate that grief.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Personification:** "Grief grieves" gives the abstract concept of grief the ability to act.
        *   **Repetition:** "Grief grieves" reinforces the idea of suffering as the subject.

*   **"Deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood,"**

    *   **Meaning:**  Profound sorrow progresses forward steadily, like a slowly moving, powerful river.  There is a sense of inevitability and relentless progression.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Simile:**  "Like a gentle flood" uses comparison to create a vivid image of grief's unstoppable movement.
        *   **Alliteration:** "Deep woes" creates a subtle sonic link.

*   **"Who being stopp'd, the bounding banks o'erflows;"**

    *   **Meaning:**  If this flood of sorrow is dammed or stopped up, it will inevitably break through its confines (like a river overflowing its banks) and become even more destructive.  Suppressed grief will ultimately erupt.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Metaphor:**  Expanding on the flood metaphor; the "banks" are the restraints, boundaries, or attempts to control grief.

*   **"Grief dallied with nor law nor limit knows."**

    *   **Meaning:**  Grief does not adhere to rules, boundaries, or restrictions. It is unrestrained and uncontrollable.  "Dallied with" suggests that grief is not something to be trifled with.
    *   **Literary Devices:**
        *   **Personification:** Grief is given the capacity to disobey ("nor law nor limit knows").
        *   **Tricolon:** The phrase "nor law nor limit" consists of three words, adding emphasis to the meaning.

**Overall Meaning of the Stanza:**

This stanza explores the torturous nature of grief, particularly when relief is tantalizingly close but unattainable, and the destructive potential of suppressed grief. The nearness of help or a cure only serves to magnify the suffering. The stanza asserts that grief is a powerful and overwhelming force that cannot be easily controlled or restrained. If one tries to suppress it, it will inevitably break free and become even more destructive. The images of drowning near shore, starving with food in sight, and wounds aching at the sight of salve all emphasize the profound agony of having hope dangled before you, only to be denied. It is a commentary on the destructive nature of both grief itself and the attempt to control it, implying that the best course of action is to acknowledge grief and let it flow rather than try to dam it up, which leads to more destructive consequences.

In the context of the poem, the stanza reflects Lucrece's mental state as she grapples with the overwhelming grief and shame caused by her rape.  She is surrounded by the potential for healing and justice (her husband, her family, the legal system), but those possibilities are ultimately insufficient to overcome the trauma. Her grief, therefore, festers and contributes to her decision to commit suicide.
