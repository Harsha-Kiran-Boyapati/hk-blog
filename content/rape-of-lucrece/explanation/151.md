# Stanza 151 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
'O, that is gone for which I sought to live,
And therefore now I need not fear to die.
To clear this spot by death, at least I give
A badge of fame to slander's livery;
A dying life to living infamy:
Poor helpless help, the treasure stol'n away,
To burn the guiltless casket where it lay!
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Let's break down Stanza 151 of 'The Rape of Lucrece' line by line, highlighting the literary devices used, and then providing an overall interpretation.

**Line 1: 'O, that is gone for which I sought to live,'**

*   **Analysis:** This line expresses Lucrece's profound despair. "That" refers to her chastity and honor, which she considers the sole reason for her existence. Now that it's lost, she sees no purpose in living.
*   **Literary Device:**
    *   **Metonymy:** "That" stands in for her chastity and honor, using a related concept to represent the abstract idea.

**Line 2: 'And therefore now I need not fear to die.'**

*   **Analysis:** Logically follows from the previous line. Since the reason for her living is gone, the fear of death is also gone. Death is no longer a threat but a release.
*   **Literary Device:**
    *   **Logical Consequence:** The sentence is a direct result of the preceding statement.

**Line 3: 'To clear this spot by death, at least I give'**

*   **Analysis:** Lucrece believes her death will, in some way, cleanse the stain of her rape. "This spot" refers to her body, her reputation, and the shame brought upon her family. She views her death as a form of atonement.
*   **Literary Device:**
    *   **Metaphor:** "Spot" represents the stain of dishonor.

**Line 4: 'A badge of fame to slander's livery;'**

*   **Analysis:** "Livery" is the uniform worn by servants, in this case the "servants" of Slander. By killing herself, she is turning her death into a symbol of Slander's victory, but also giving it a *badge of fame*. The phrase is complex. Her death provides concrete proof of the devastation slander (i.e., the damage to her reputation) has wrought, making the slander itself more "famous" or powerful. But there's also an ironic suggestion that her death, though born of slander, will ultimately bring her *fame* for virtue and sacrifice.
*   **Literary Devices:**
    *   **Metaphor:** Slander is personified as an entity with servants. "Livery" is a visual metaphor.
    *   **Paradox/Ironic Twist:** Her death is meant to clear her name, but it simultaneously gives slander a "badge of fame".

**Line 5: 'A dying life to living infamy:'**

*   **Analysis:** This line further emphasizes the paradoxical nature of Lucrece's decision. Her "dying life" (her death) will ensure that Tarquin's "living infamy" (his lasting disgrace) will persist.  Her death becomes a testament to his crime.
*   **Literary Devices:**
    *   **Antithesis:** "Dying life" versus "living infamy." The contrasting words highlight the opposing forces at play.
    *   **Juxtaposition:** Putting these two concepts close together emphasizes their contrast.

**Line 6: 'Poor helpless help, the treasure stol'n away,'**

*   **Analysis:** This is a poignant description of Lucrece herself. She is "poor helpless help" because she cannot truly help herself. Even her suicide is a form of "help," an attempt to restore honor, but it's tragically insufficient. "The treasure stol'n away" refers to her lost chastity.
*   **Literary Devices:**
    *   **Oxymoron:** "Helpless help" highlights the inadequacy of her actions.
    *   **Metaphor:** She is "the treasure stol'n away," equating her chastity to a valuable possession.

**Line 7: 'To burn the guiltless casket where it lay!'**

*   **Analysis:** The "guiltless casket" is Lucrece's body, which is innocent of the crime of rape. The "it" in "where it lay" refers back to the treasure, her chastity. Burning the casket signifies destroying her body, an act driven by the theft of her chastity. She is punishing the vessel that held the treasure that was taken.
*   **Literary Devices:**
    *   **Metaphor:** Her body is compared to a "casket."
    *   **Imagery:** The image of burning is vivid and reinforces the sense of destruction and sacrifice.

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza reveals Lucrece's desperate and tormented state of mind. She believes that her honor is irreparably damaged, and she can only restore it through death. Her death is not seen as a mere act of despair, but as a complex and paradoxical attempt to cleanse the "spot" of dishonor, provide a lasting indictment of Tarquin's crime, and prevent further infamy. The stanza is filled with contrasting ideas, such as dying life versus living infamy, and helpless help. These contrasts underscore the tragic irony of Lucrece's situation and her attempt to regain control of her reputation through self-destruction. Ultimately, she sees her body as a tainted vessel, a "guiltless casket," that must be destroyed to atone for the stolen "treasure" of her chastity. The stanza is a powerful exploration of honor, shame, and the destructive consequences of sexual violence.
