# Stanza 175 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
Her mistress she doth give demure good-morrow,
With soft-slow tongue, true mark of modesty,
And sorts a sad look to her lady's sorrow,
For why her face wore sorrow's livery;
But durst not ask of her audaciously
Why her two suns were cloud-eclipsed so,
Nor why her fair cheeks over-wash'd with woe.
```

**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza paints a picture of a servant observing Lucrece in deep distress. The servant is polite, respectful, and aware of Lucrece's sorrow. She expresses her empathy by mirroring Lucrece's sadness, but she remains mindful of her place and refrains from intruding with direct or probing questions.  The stanza emphasizes the rigid social hierarchy of the time and the expected behavior of servants towards their superiors. It also highlights the profound sadness that Lucrece is experiencing, a sadness so overwhelming that it is immediately apparent to those around her. The servant is a passive observer, respectful and concerned, but ultimately powerless to help.

**Literary Devices:**

*   **Metaphor:** The most prominent device is the metaphor of Lucrece's eyes as "two suns." This emphasizes her beauty and the brilliance that has now been dimmed by sorrow. "sorrow's livery" is also a metaphor.
*   **Imagery:** The stanza is rich in visual imagery. We can picture the servant's demure greeting, Lucrece's sorrowful face, and her tear-stained cheeks.  The image of the "cloud-eclipsed" suns is particularly vivid.
*   **Alliteration:** The phrase "soft-slow tongue" uses alliteration to emphasize the gentleness of the servant's speech.
*   **Archaic Language:** The use of phrases like "doth give," "good-morrow," and "for why" contributes to the formal and somewhat distant tone of the poem.
*   **Personification** could be seen in "sorrow's livery" giving sorrow the human trait of being able to wear clothes.

In summary, this stanza is a carefully crafted portrait of a mistress's sorrow and a servant's cautious observation, rich in imagery and figures of speech that contribute to the overall tragic atmosphere of *The Rape of Lucrece*.
