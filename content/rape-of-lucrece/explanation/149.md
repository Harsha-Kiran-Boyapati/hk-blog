# Stanza 149 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
This said, from her be-tumbled couch she starteth,
To find some desperate instrument of death:
But this no slaughterhouse no tool imparteth
To make more vent for passage of her breath;
Which, thronging through her lips, so vanisheth
As smoke from AEtna, that in air consumes,
Or that which from discharged cannon fumes.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down this stanza from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* line by line, then look at the overall meaning and literary devices.

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"This said, from her be-tumbled couch she starteth,"**
    *   **"This said"**:  Refers to her internal decision, likely her resolve to take action after the rape (likely referring to a resolve to take her own life).
    *   **"from her be-tumbled couch"**:  The bed is described as "be-tumbled," emphasizing the violence and disruption of the rape. It's a visual image of the struggle and disarray. "Be-" is an archaic prefix.
    *   **"she starteth"**:  She jumps up suddenly from the bed. The verb "starteth" suggests a frantic, impulsive action.

*   **"To find some desperate instrument of death:"**
    *   **"To find"**: Her purpose is clear - she is searching, urgently.
    *   **"some desperate instrument of death"**:  She seeks any object that can kill her. The adjective "desperate" underscores her mental state and the severity of her situation. "Instrument of death" is a euphemism, softening the harsh reality.

*   **"But this no slaughterhouse no tool imparteth"**
    *   **"But this no slaughterhouse"**:  The immediate environment, the room where she finds herself, is contrasted with a slaughterhouse. She cannot easily find what she seeks.
    *   **"no tool imparteth"**:  Emphasizes the lack of tools available for her suicide. "Imparteth" means to give or provide. The room does not offer her a quick way out.

*   **"To make more vent for passage of her breath;"**
    *   **"To make more vent for passage of her breath"**:  This describes what she intends to do to her body. "Vent for passage" is a roundabout way of saying a wound or opening to release her life. This hints at a violent act of self-harm.

*   **"Which, thronging through her lips, so vanisheth"**
    *   **"Which, thronging through her lips"**: This describes the act of exhaling. "Thronging" suggests her breath is rushed, panicked, or filled with her pent-up emotion.
    *   **"so vanisheth"**: Her breath fades away quickly.

*   **"As smoke from AEtna, that in air consumes,"**
    *   **"As smoke from AEtna"**:  This is a simile. Mount Etna, a Sicilian volcano, is used as a comparison. The imagery is of smoke rising from a powerful, destructive source.
    *   **"that in air consumes"**: The smoke dissipates into the air. This mirrors the way Lucrece's breath (and potentially her life) will disappear.

*   **"Or that which from discharged cannon fumes."**
    *   **"Or that which from discharged cannon fumes"**:  Another simile. This is a comparison to smoke from a fired cannon. This image reinforces violence and sudden release of energy. "Fumes" suggests a short, quick puff of smoke.

**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza depicts Lucrece's immediate reaction to her rape. She is filled with despair and a desire for death. She desperately looks for a weapon, but cannot find one. The stanza focuses on her breath, using vivid similes of smoke from Mount Etna and a cannon to illustrate how quickly and completely she feels her life and spirit are fading away. The imagery emphasizes the violence and destruction that has been inflicted upon her. The stanza sets the stage for her eventual suicide and highlights the profound sense of loss and hopelessness she experiences.

**Literary Devices:**

*   **Simile**:  The stanza relies heavily on simile to convey Lucrece's state of mind.  The comparisons to smoke from Mount Etna and cannon fumes powerfully illustrate the fleeting nature of her breath and the destructive force of the rape.
*   **Euphemism**: "Instrument of death" is a more delicate way of referring to a weapon for suicide.
*   **Imagery**: The stanza is rich in vivid imagery, especially the descriptions of the "be-tumbled couch," the smoke from Etna, and the cannon fumes. These images create a strong sense of the scene and Lucrece's emotional state.
*   **Alliteration**: AEtna and air. The /a/ sound here reinforces the fading nature of Lucrece's breath.
*   **Personification**: "No tool imparteth." Giving the room or tools the ability to "impart" or give something.

In essence, this stanza is a powerful snapshot of Lucrece's devastation and her suicidal ideation, conveyed through striking imagery and carefully chosen language.
