# Stanza 85 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
'All which together, like a troubled ocean,
Beat at thy rocky and wreck-threatening heart,
To soften it with their continual motion;
For stones dissolved to water do convert.
O, if no harder than a stone thou art,
Melt at my tears, and be compassionate!
Soft pity enters at an iron gate.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"All which together, like a troubled ocean,"**

    *   **Meaning:** This line introduces a metaphor comparing the combined effect of Tarquin's arguments, threats, and pleas to a stormy, chaotic ocean. "All which together" refers to the cumulative pressure Tarquin is putting on Lucrece.
    *   **Literary Device:** **Simile** ("like a troubled ocean"). This immediately establishes the image of overwhelming force and agitation. The "troubled ocean" suggests a feeling of instability and threat.

*   **"Beat at thy rocky and wreck-threatening heart,"**

    *   **Meaning:** The "troubled ocean" of Tarquin's words and actions are being metaphorically slammed against Lucrece's heart. The heart is described as "rocky and wreck-threatening," meaning it is hard, resistant, and capable of causing destruction (likely referring to the potential destruction of Tarquin's reputation if she reveals his intentions).
    *   **Literary Device:** **Metaphor:** Lucrece's heart is not literally a rock, but the description conveys its coldness and resistance. **Imagery:** The imagery of "beating" against a "rocky" heart creates a vivid picture of a relentless assault. **Alliteration:** The repetition of the 'w' sound in "wreck-threatening" adds to the intensity.

*   **"To soften it with their continual motion;"**

    *   **Meaning:** This suggests that the *purpose* of the relentless "beating" is to break down Lucrece's resistance, to make her heart more yielding. "Continual motion" implies a persistent and ongoing effort.
    *   **Literary Device:** None particularly stand out, but the line continues to build on the extended metaphor.

*   **"For stones dissolved to water do convert."**

    *   **Meaning:** This provides a justification for Tarquin's belief that Lucrece can be softened. It is a proverbial statement, suggesting that even the hardest things can eventually be worn down by constant pressure. Stones dissolving into water is a well known analogy for how time and persistence can change even the most resistant things.
    *   **Literary Device:** **Proverb/Analogy:** This is a saying that relies on a physical example that everyone understands, and therefore it seems more likely to be true.

*   **"O, if no harder than a stone thou art,"**

    *   **Meaning:** This is a direct address to Lucrece (an apostrophe). Tarquin is using this line to say that she should not be more resistant than a stone. He believes that she is, in fact, softer than a stone because she has feelings and is a woman.
    *   **Literary Device:** **Apostrophe:** Direct address to someone (or something) who is not literally there, or cannot respond. It adds a personal, dramatic quality.

*   **"Melt at my tears, and be compassionate!"**

    *   **Meaning:** Here, Tarquin directly asks Lucrece to show him pity and let his tears influence her. He's imploring her to succumb to his desires. This is emotional manipulation. He's trying to guilt or sway her.
    *   **Literary Device:** **Imperative verbs:** "Melt" and "be" are commands, highlighting Tarquin's forceful and demanding tone, despite the show of tears. **Imagery:** The imagery of "melting" reinforces the earlier metaphor of softening resistance.

*   **"Soft pity enters at an iron gate."**

    *   **Meaning:** This is perhaps the most layered line. It suggests that even a heart as fortified as Lucrece's ("iron gate") can be penetrated by "soft pity." This could be interpreted in two ways: 1) Tarquin is arguing that *his* pity (or feigned pity) should move her. 2) He is suggesting that *her* pity for him should move her to yield. The "iron gate" is a metaphor for her resolve and her virtue.
    *   **Literary Device:** **Metaphor:** As above, "iron gate" is a metaphor for her strong resolve. **Paradox/Irony:** The line itself is somewhat paradoxical. "Soft pity" and "iron gate" seem contradictory, highlighting the tension between Lucrece's virtue and the possibility of being moved by emotion.

**Overall Meaning of the Stanza:**

This stanza is a crucial part of Tarquin's persuasive (or manipulative) rhetoric. He's attempting to break down Lucrece's resistance by comparing his pressure to the constant force of the ocean against a rock. He argues that even the hardest heart can be softened by persistent appeals and that Lucrece, if she's no harder than a stone, should be moved by his tears and show him compassion. The final line, with its image of "soft pity" entering an "iron gate," is a key statement of Tarquin's belief that he can overcome her defenses, either by inspiring pity in her for *him* or by offering his own *feigned pity*. The stanza reveals his understanding of psychological warfare and his willingness to exploit Lucrece's potential for empathy. It demonstrates the power of rhetoric in shaping action and setting the stage for the tragic events to come.
