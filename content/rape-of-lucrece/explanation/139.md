# Stanza 139 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
'Thou ceaseless lackey to eternity,
With some mischance cross Tarquin in his flight:
Devise extremes beyond extremity,
To make him curse this cursed crimeful night:
Let ghastly shadows his lewd eyes affright;
And the dire thought of his committed evil
Shape every bush a hideous shapeless devil.

        *   **Hyperbole:** Exaggeration for effect; suggesting punishments that surpass all known limits.

    *   *Literary Devices:*
        *   **Imagery:** The vivid description of "hideous shapeless devil" creates a strong image of terror.
        *   **Metaphor:** The bush becoming a devil symbolizes how Tarquin's guilt distorts his perception of reality.

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza is a powerful curse invoked against Tarquin. The speaker implores time to punish him relentlessly, going beyond any conceivable measure of suffering. The stanza highlights the speaker's desire for Tarquin to experience psychological torment. The visions, the fear, the distortion of reality are all meant to drive him to despair and to make him forever regret his crime. The imagery is deliberately designed to create a sense of intense dread and psychological torment, suggesting the profound impact of Tarquin's actions and the depth of Lucrece's suffering, even in her call for revenge. It focuses on the *internal* consequences of Tarquin's actions. It's a very active and vivid expression of revenge.
