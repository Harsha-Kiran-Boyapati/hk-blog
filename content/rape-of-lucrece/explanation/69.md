# Stanza 69 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
Thus he replies: 'The colour in thy face,
That even for anger makes the lily pale,
And the red rose blush at her own disgrace,
Shall plead for me and tell my loving tale:
Under that colour am I come to scale
Thy never-conquer'd fort: the fault is thine,
For those thine eyes betray thee unto mine.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"Thus he replies: 'The colour in thy face,"**
    *   *Meaning:* This sets the scene, indicating that Tarquin is responding to Lucrece's initial protests or attempts to deter him. He is focusing on her physical appearance, particularly her complexion.
*   **"That even for anger makes the lily pale,"**
    *   *Meaning:* Lucrece's anger, paradoxically, drains the color from her face, making her skin so white it puts the lily (a symbol of purity and whiteness) to shame. The lily is *metonymy* for whiteness.
    *   *Literary Device:* **Hyperbole** (exaggeration) - it's unlikely that anger *literally* makes her face whiter than a lily. **Metonymy**.
*   **"And the red rose blush at her own disgrace,"**
    *   *Meaning:* Conversely, the flush of red anger that should naturally appear is so intense that it would even make a red rose (a symbol of beauty and passion) feel ashamed by comparison.
    *   *Literary Device:* **Hyperbole** (again, exaggeration). **Personification** (the rose is blushing). **Metonymy**.
*   **"Shall plead for me and tell my loving tale:"**
    *   *Meaning:* Tarquin is now twisting the situation. He claims that her beautiful, expressive face ‚Äì the very evidence of her distress and anger ‚Äì will actually argue on his behalf and convince her of his love. He is manipulating her reaction to his advances and portraying it as a sign of attraction.
    *   *Literary Device:* **Irony** (He's turning her resistance into a reason to justify his actions).
*   **"Under that colour am I come to scale"**
    *   *Meaning:* He uses a military metaphor, comparing himself to a soldier who is *scaling* (climbing) a fort. The "colour" here refers to her complexion, which he sees as a sort of fortification. The "under" suggests he's using her beauty as a shield, or as a justification for his assault.
    *   *Literary Device:* **Metaphor** (Tarquin is not literally scaling a fort, but comparing his pursuit of Lucrece to a military assault).
*   **"Thy never-conquer'd fort: the fault is thine,"**
    *   *Meaning:* Lucrece is the fort that has never been conquered before. Tarquin is placing the blame on her, saying it's her fault that he's attacking her.
    *   *Literary Device:* **Metaphor** (Extending the "fort" metaphor). **Blaming the Victim** (A manipulative tactic).
*   **"For those thine eyes betray thee unto mine."**
    *   *Meaning:* Her eyes, her innermost being, have supposedly revealed her true desire to him. He suggests that she has been secretly inviting his advances with her gaze, despite her outward protests.
    *   *Literary Device:* **False Attribution** (He's projecting his desires onto her).

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza is a critical moment in the poem where Tarquin attempts to justify his impending assault on Lucrece. He uses manipulative language, turning her distress into a twisted justification for his actions. He weaponizes her beauty, suggesting that her expressive face and eyes have essentially lured him into attacking her. He presents himself as a conqueror, and Lucrece as a previously unconquered fortress, further diminishing her agency. The stanza reveals his warped perspective, his lack of empathy, and his determination to absolve himself of guilt by blaming Lucrece for his own vile intentions. It is a masterclass in psychological manipulation and the abuse of power. The irony is heavy as he uses her natural reactions of anger and fear to fuel his predatory pursuit.

**Key Literary Devices:**

*   **Hyperbole:** Exaggeration to emphasize Lucrece's beauty and the intensity of her emotions.
*   **Metaphor:** Comparing Lucrece to a "fort" and Tarquin's pursuit to "scaling" it.
*   **Personification:** Giving human qualities to the "red rose" (blushing).
*   **Irony:** Tarquin twisting Lucrece's resistance into a justification for his assault.
*   **Blaming the Victim:** He tries to shift the responsibility for his actions onto Lucrece.
*   **Metonymy:** Using 'lily' to mean whiteness, and 'rose' to mean beauty.
*   **False Attribution:** Projecting his desires onto Lucrece and claiming her eyes "betray" her.

In essence, this stanza is a disturbing example of power dynamics and how easily language can be used to twist reality and excuse horrific actions. It highlights the dangers of manipulation and the violation of consent that lies at the heart of the poem.
