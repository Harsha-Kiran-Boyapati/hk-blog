# Stanza 227 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
But now the mindful messenger, come back,
Brings home his lord and other company;
Who finds his Lucrece clad in mourning black,
And round about her tear-distained eye
Blue circles streamed, like rainbows in the sky.
These water-galls in her dim element
Foretell new storms to those already spent.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down stanza 227 of Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece*:

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"But now the mindful messenger, come back,"**
    *   *Meaning:* The messenger who was sent to bring Lucrece's husband, Collatinus, returns. The messenger is described as "mindful" meaning aware of the gravity of the situation or diligent in his duty.
    *   *Literary Devices:* This is a relatively straightforward introduction of the return of Collatinus.

*   **"Brings home his lord and other company;"**
    *   *Meaning:* The messenger brings Collatinus (Lucrece's husband) and his companions. This emphasizes that Collatinus isn't returning alone; he has support or witnesses with him.
    *   *Literary Devices:* Again, fairly direct exposition.

*   **"Who finds his Lucrece clad in mourning black,"**
    *   *Meaning:* Collatinus sees Lucrece dressed in black, the traditional color of mourning. This immediately indicates something terrible has happened.
    *   *Literary Devices:* **Imagery:** The stark image of Lucrece in black creates a visual impact and foreshadows the tragic news.

*   **"And round about her tear-distained eye"**
    *   *Meaning:* Her eyes are swollen and marked by the effects of excessive crying. "Tear-distained" implies the tears have left their mark, physically altering her appearance.
    *   *Literary Devices:* **Imagery:** Emphasizes the extent of Lucrece's suffering.
    *   **Alliteration:** The 't' sound in "tear-distained" adds emphasis.

*   **"Blue circles streamed, like rainbows in the sky."**
    *   *Meaning:* The dark circles under her eyes are compared to rainbows in the sky. This comparison, while seemingly beautiful, is actually quite disturbing in context. It highlights the unnatural and unsettling appearance caused by her distress.
    *   *Literary Devices:* **Simile:** The comparison using "like" connects the blue circles to rainbows.
    *   **Irony:** The use of a beautiful image like a rainbow to describe a sign of grief creates a jarring contrast and underscores the unnaturalness of the situation. The beauty of a rainbow is associated with hope and happiness, which is starkly contrasted with Lucrece's despair.

*   **"These water-galls in her dim element"**
    *   *Meaning:* "Water-galls" is an archaic term for broken or disturbed patches of the rainbow, often seen as harbingers of stormy weather. "Dim element" refers to Lucrece's weakened and sorrowful state (her eyes are her "element", a source of light and beauty, now dimmed by grief). So, the dark circles (water-galls) within her distressed eyes (dim element).
    *   *Literary Devices:* **Metaphor:** "Water-galls" is used metaphorically to describe the dark circles and the signs of impending trouble. "Dim element" is another metaphor for Lucrece's current state.

*   **"Foretell new storms to those already spent."**
    *   *Meaning:* The physical signs of her grief (the dark circles) are a warning that more suffering (new storms) are to come, even after the terrible event (the rape) that has already occurred. This line suggests that the consequences of the rape will continue to unfold and cause further pain.
    *   *Literary Devices:* **Foreshadowing:** Hints at future suffering and tragedy.
    *   **Metaphor:** The "storms" represent further trials and tribulations.

**Overall Meaning:**

This stanza describes the arrival of Collatinus and his companions to find Lucrece in a state of intense mourning. The description of her tear-stained face and the dark circles under her eyes, compared to disturbed rainbows, foreshadows that the rape is not the end of the tragedy. Her grief is a sign of more trouble to come, indicating the lasting and devastating impact of Tarquin's actions. The stanza emphasizes the gravity of the situation and sets the stage for the revelations and consequences that will follow. It highlights not only the immediate shock and grief but also the long-term damage the rape will inflict.
