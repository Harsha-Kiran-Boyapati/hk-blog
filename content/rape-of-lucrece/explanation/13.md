# Stanza 13 - Explanation

## Original Stanza
```
This earthly saint, adored by this devil,
Little suspecteth the false worshipper;
For unstain'd thoughts do seldom dream on evil;
Birds never limed no secret bushes fear:
So guiltless she securely gives good cheer
And reverend welcome to her princely guest,
Whose inward ill no outward harm express'd:
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
This stanza from Shakespeare's *The Rape of Lucrece* depicts Lucrece's unsuspecting nature and Tarquin's deceptive appearance. Let's break it down line by line:

* **"This earthly saint, adored by this devil,"**  This line establishes a stark contrast using antithesis. Lucrece is presented as an "earthly saint," implying purity and innocence, while Tarquin, her admirer, is a "devil," representing evil and deceit.  The juxtaposition immediately sets the stage for the tragedy.

* **"Little suspecteth the false worshipper;"**  This reinforces Lucrece's innocence.  She has little suspicion of Tarquin's true nature, highlighting her naivet√© and the deceptive nature of his "worship."  The word "worshipper" is ironic, as his adoration is a pretense.

* **"For unstain'd thoughts do seldom dream on evil;"** This line explains Lucrece's lack of suspicion.  Her pure mind, symbolized by "unstain'd thoughts," prevents her from imagining or suspecting evil intentions. This is a statement about the nature of innocence and its vulnerability to deception.

* **"Birds never limed no secret bushes fear:"** This is a simile, comparing Lucrece's innocence to a bird unaware of a trap.  Birds that haven't been caught in birdlime (a sticky substance used to trap birds) don't fear hidden bushes. This emphasizes her lack of experience with treachery and her resulting vulnerability.  Note the double negative ("never limed no") for emphasis.

* **"So guiltless she securely gives good cheer"** This line directly connects Lucrece's innocence ("guiltless") to her actions.  She offers hospitality ("good cheer") without suspicion. The word "securely" underlines her misplaced confidence.

* **"And reverend welcome to her princely guest,"**  This line describes her respectful reception of Tarquin, emphasizing her proper behavior and respect for his high social standing ("princely guest").  This further highlights the irony of the situation.

* **"Whose inward ill no outward harm express'd:"** This final line reveals Tarquin's deception.  His inner wickedness ("inward ill") is completely hidden ("no outward harm express'd"), making him appear harmless and trustworthy. This is dramatic irony; the reader knows his true nature, but Lucrece does not.

**Overall Meaning:**

The stanza portrays the crucial imbalance of power and knowledge between Lucrece and Tarquin.  Lucrece's innocence and purity blind her to Tarquin's malicious intent.  Shakespeare uses imagery and similes to highlight her vulnerability and Tarquin's cunning deception.  The stanza foreshadows the tragic events to come, emphasizing the devastating consequences of innocence encountering deliberate malice. The use of antithesis, simile, and dramatic irony are central to creating this effect and setting the tone for the entire poem.
