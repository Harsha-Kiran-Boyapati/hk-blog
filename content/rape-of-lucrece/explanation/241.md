## Original Stanza
```
‚ÄúAnd for my sake, when I might charm thee so,
For she that was thy Lucrece, now attend me:

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis
Okay, let's break down this powerful stanza from *The Rape of Lucrece*.

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

*   **"And for my sake, when I might charm thee so,"**
    *   **Literal Meaning:** Consider my sake, the time I could have charmed you.
    *   **Analysis:** Lucrece is addressing her husband, Collatinus, and reminding him of the time when she was alive, unviolated, and a source of charm and pleasure for him. This highlights what he has lost and the emotional damage done to him.

*   **"For she that was thy Lucrece, now attend me:"**
    *   **Literal Meaning:** Because the Lucrece you knew is gone, listen to me now.
    *   **Analysis:** Lucrece emphasizes the radical transformation she has undergone through the rape. She is no longer the same woman. This emphasizes the gravity of Tarquin's crime ‚Äì he has essentially killed her old self. "Attend me" is a demand for his attention and obedience to her final wish.

*   **"Be suddenly revenged on my foe,"**
    *   **Literal Meaning:** Take swift revenge on my enemy.
    *   **Analysis:** This is the core command of the stanza. She calls for immediate action, not measured or delayed justice, but swift retribution. "Suddenly" underscores the urgency and intensity of her demand.

*   **"Thine, mine, his own. Suppose thou dost defend me"**
    *   **Literal Meaning:** He is your enemy, mine, and his own (Tarquin's) too. Imagine that by seeking revenge, you are defending me.
    *   **Analysis:** This line employs **tricolon**, a series of three parallel clauses, to emphasize the multifaceted nature of Tarquin's treachery. He is an enemy to Collatinus (for violating his wife), to Lucrece (for the rape), and even to himself (because his actions are self-destructive and lead to his downfall).  The phrase "Suppose thou dost defend me" acts as a motivation, implying that by avenging her, Collatinus will be protecting her honor in death. This is a subtle attempt to transfer agency and responsibility.

*   **"From what is past. The help that thou shalt lend me"**
    *   **Literal Meaning:** (defend me) from what already happened. The help you are about to offer.
    *   **Analysis:** Lucrece acknowledges the finality of what has happened. Revenge can't undo the rape, but it can provide a form of justice and retribution. This shows her awareness that her death and the revenge are not truly about her in the present, but about shaping the future.

*   **"Comes all too late, yet let the traitor die,"**
    *   **Literal Meaning:** The help comes too late to save me, but still, let the traitor die.
    *   **Analysis:** There's a crucial **concession** here. She admits the futility of revenge in saving her life or restoring her purity. "All too late" highlights the tragedy. Despite this, she still insists on Tarquin's death. This reinforces the idea that revenge is not about her personal salvation but about justice and preventing future atrocities.

*   **"For sparing justice feeds iniquity."**
    *   **Literal Meaning:** Because not enacting justice allows wickedness to flourish.
    *   **Analysis:** This is a powerful statement about the consequences of inaction. "Sparing justice" (i.e., failing to punish the guilty) is seen as actively enabling further wrongdoing.  This acts as a strong justification for her demand, positioning revenge as a moral imperative, not just a personal desire. It's also an example of a **gnomic statement**, a proverb-like expression of a general truth. "Feeds iniquity" employs **personification**, giving iniquity the quality of being fed and growing stronger.

**Overall Meaning:**

In this stanza, Lucrece, facing imminent death after her rape, implores her husband Collatinus to seek immediate and total revenge on Tarquin. She acknowledges that this revenge cannot undo the harm done to her, but it is still essential to ensure justice and prevent future atrocities.  She argues that failing to punish Tarquin will only encourage further wickedness, making revenge a moral imperative rather than a selfish act. She uses a combination of appeals to his love for her, his sense of honor, and his civic duty to motivate him to action, framing her death as a catalyst for a greater good.

**Literary Devices Summary:**

*   **Tricolon:** The repetition of "thine, mine, his own" for emphasis.
*   **Concession:** Acknowledging the futility of revenge in saving her life, but still demanding it.
*   **Gnomic Statement:** "For sparing justice feeds iniquity" ‚Äì a proverb-like expression of a general truth.
*   **Personification:** "Feeds iniquity" - giving iniquity the ability to be fed.
*   **Rhetorical Question (Implied):** She doesn't ask outright, but she directs a forceful command which strongly implies that the answer should be 'yes'.

This stanza is a key moment in the poem, highlighting Lucrece's strength, her commitment to justice, and her desire to use her tragic fate to prevent future suffering. It is a powerful call to action that sets the stage for the political upheaval that follows.
