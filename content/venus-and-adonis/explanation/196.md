## üìñ Original Stanza
```
She bows her head, the new-sprung flower to smell,
Comparing it to her Adonis' breath;        
And says within her bosom it shall dwell,
Since he himself is reft from her by death:
She drops the stalk, and in the breach appears
Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears.

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza shows Venus attempting to recreate intimacy with Adonis through the flower while accidentally revealing that even his transformed state shares her capacity for grief and loss.

**Sensory Intimacy**: Venus seeks connection through smell, the most memory-laden sense, comparing the flower's fragrance to "her Adonis' breath." This shows her desperate need to find traces of their physical relationship.

**The Sacred Heart**: By declaring the flower "shall dwell" within her "bosom," Venus makes her heart the flower's sanctuary, creating the most intimate possible relationship with Adonis's new form.

**Death as Theft**: Venus describes death as having "reft" Adonis from her, presenting mortality as an act of robbery rather than natural process. This personalizes death as an enemy rather than a law of nature.

**Accidental Revelation**: When Venus "drops the stalk," her emotional state causes accidental damage, revealing that she cannot handle even the transformed Adonis without causing harm‚Äîechoing her earlier destructive love.

**Universal Grief**: The green sap that flows from the broken stem becomes tears, suggesting that the flower-Adonis shares Venus's capacity for sorrow. Even in transformation, pain persists.

**The Inadequacy of Substitution**: While Venus tries to replace Adonis with the flower, her rough handling shows that no substitute can satisfy her need for the actual person.

**Maternal Imagery**: The flower dwelling in her bosom suggests both romantic and maternal possession‚ÄîVenus will nurture and protect this remnant of Adonis.

**The Fragility of Beauty**: The easily broken stem shows that beauty remains vulnerable even in its transformed state, requiring careful handling that Venus's passionate nature cannot provide.

**Shared Mortality**: The flower's ability to be wounded and "bleed" sap suggests that even Adonis's transformed state retains vulnerability, making the metamorphosis incomplete protection.

**Intimate Knowledge**: Venus's ability to compare the flower's scent to Adonis's breath reveals the depth of her physical knowledge of him, showing how thoroughly she had memorized his body.

**The Persistence of Loss**: Even though Adonis has been preserved in flower form, Venus's grief continues and is now shared by the flower itself, making transformation bittersweet rather than consoling.

This stanza shows that Venus's relationship with the transformed Adonis retains the same dynamics as her relationship with the human Adonis‚Äîpassionate, possessive, and ultimately harmful to its object.
