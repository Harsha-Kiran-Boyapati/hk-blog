‚ÄòI have been woo‚Äôd, as I entreat thee now,
Even by the stern and direful god of war,
Whose sinewy neck in battle ne‚Äôer did bow,
Who conquers where he comes in every jar;    
Yet hath he been my captive and my slave,
And begg‚Äôd for that which thou unask‚Äôd shalt have.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: ‚ÄòI have been woo‚Äôd, as I entreat thee now,
*   **"woo‚Äôd"**: To court or pursue someone romantically with the intention of gaining their love or marriage. Here, it signifies Venus's past experience of being the object of desire, highlighting her own allure and status as a coveted figure. Shakespeare uses this to establish her credentials as someone who understands the dynamics of pursuit, setting a parallel to her current active role.
*   **"entreat thee now"**: To earnestly or anxiously ask or implore someone to do something. This phrase underscores Venus's urgent and pleading tone, emphasizing the intensity of her current desire for Adonis, which is so strong that it compels her, a goddess, to beg.
*   **Meaning:** "I myself have been courted and pursued in the very same way I am now earnestly pleading with you."

---

### Line 2: Even by the stern and direful god of war,
*   **"stern"**: Serious, severe, and unrelenting, often implying a forbidding or unyielding nature. It characterizes the god's grave demeanor and absolute authority.
*   **"direful"**: Causing dread, terrible, or dreadful. This word intensifies the description of the god, emphasizing his fearsome and formidable aspect.
*   **"god of war"**: Referring to Mars (Ares in Greek mythology), known for his immense power, ferocity, and dominance in battle. Shakespeare uses this specific deity to immediately establish the unparalleled strength and fearsome reputation of Venus's former suitor, thereby magnifying the significance of her influence over him.
*   **Meaning:** "Even the serious, severe, and terrible god of war has pursued me."

---

### Line 3: Whose sinewy neck in battle ne‚Äôer did bow,
*   **"sinewy neck"**: "Sinewy" means having strong, well-developed tendons or muscles, denoting great physical strength and power. A strong, unyielding neck suggests indomitable will and a refusal to submit or surrender. Shakespeare uses this imagery to vividly portray Mars's physical might and his unyielding nature, making his eventual submission to Venus even more remarkable.
*   **"ne‚Äôer did bow"**: Never yielded, never submitted, never bent in defeat. In the context of battle, this implies he was never vanquished or forced into a subservient posture. This phrase reinforces Mars's image as an invincible warrior, underscoring the extraordinary power Venus claims to hold over him.
*   **Meaning:** "Whose strong, muscular neck never bent in defeat or surrender during any battle."

---

### Line 4: Who conquers where he comes in every jar;
*   **"conquers where he comes"**: He is victorious in every place he enters; he dominates every encounter. This phrase reiterates Mars's absolute supremacy and his reputation as an unstoppable force.
*   **"in every jar"**: "Jar" here is an archaic usage meaning a conflict, a skirmish, a struggle, or a fight. It refers to any kind of violent encounter, not just major wars. Shakespeare uses "jar" to emphasize the universality and effortless nature of Mars's victories, implying he is undefeated in all forms of conflict.
*   **Meaning:** "Who effortlessly wins every conflict and battle he participates in."

---

### Line 5: Yet hath he been my captive and my slave,
*   **"Yet hath he been"**: Despite all his formidable power and undefeated status. "Hath" is an archaic form of "has."
*   **"my captive"**: Someone held prisoner or under complete control.
*   **"my slave"**: Someone completely dominated and subservient to another, devoid of freedom or will. Shakespeare employs these strong terms to dramatically illustrate Venus's absolute mastery over Mars, despite his formidable nature. It highlights the power of love, beauty, or desire to subdue even the most potent and dominant forces.
*   **Meaning:** "Nevertheless, despite his power, he has been my prisoner and completely submissive to me."

---

### Line 6: And begg‚Äôd for that which thou unask‚Äôd shalt have.
*   **"begg‚Äôd for that"**: Implored, pleaded, or earnestly requested for a specific thing (implicitly Venus's affection, physical intimacy, or love). This emphasizes Mars's supplicatory position, contrasting sharply with his usual dominance.
*   **"which thou unask‚Äôd shalt have"**: "Unask'd" means without being requested or sought after. "Shalt have" means will possess or receive. Venus is offering Adonis what the mighty Mars had to humbly plead for, and she is offering it freely, without any effort or request from Adonis. This is a powerful rhetorical move designed to entice Adonis by highlighting his privileged position and Venus's intense, unprompted desire for him.
*   **Meaning:** "And he had to beg intensely for what I am now offering you freely, without you even needing to ask for it."

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza is a pivotal part of Venus's persuasive rhetoric, showcasing her strategic approach to seduction. Her primary aim is to break through Adonis's youthful indifference and entice him into physical intimacy.

**Overall Meaning:** Venus asserts her immense power and desirability by recounting how even Mars, the formidable and unconquerable god of war, was utterly subdued by her charm and had to beg for her affection. She then directly flatters Adonis by offering him the very same intimacy, but freely and without him even having to ask, positioning him as even more favored and desired than the mighty Mars.

**Significance in the Context of the Poem:**

*   **Establishment of Venus's Omnipotence (in Love):** The stanza serves to immediately establish Venus as a force of nature, particularly in the realm of love and desire. By depicting her as the enslaver of Mars, Shakespeare underscores the overwhelming power of beauty and erotic love to conquer even the most dominant and destructive forces. This sets the stage for the poem's exploration of desire as an insatiable, overwhelming drive.
*   **The Conflict of Love vs. War/Chastity:** The explicit mention of Mars and his subjugation by Venus introduces one of the poem's central thematic conflicts: the irresistible power of love (represented by Venus) versus other forces. In Adonis's case, this is his preference for the chase and hunting (representing a more chaste, perhaps even violent, engagement with the world) over erotic love. Venus's anecdote attempts to prove that love triumphs over all, even war, and therefore should conquer Adonis's reluctance.
*   **Flattery as a Seduction Tactic:** Venus's strategy is clear: by elevating Adonis above the god of war, she attempts to flatter his ego and make him feel uniquely privileged and desired. This is a common tactic in seduction, aiming to make the object of desire feel special and thus more inclined to reciprocate.
*   **Reversal of Gender Roles:** The stanza highlights a significant reversal of traditional gender roles. The goddess Venus actively pursues and begs a mortal man, while simultaneously boasting of her power over the epitome of masculine strength (Mars). This subverts expectations, showcasing Venus's aggressive, almost predatory, desire, which contrasts sharply with Adonis's passive resistance. This dynamic is central to the poem's exploration of desire and agency.
*   **Forecasting Adonis's Fate:** While not directly stated, Venus's power over Mars, contrasted with Adonis's resistance, implicitly sets up the tragic irony to come. Venus can conquer Mars, but she cannot conquer Adonis's will or fate, foreshadowing the limits of her power and the tragic outcome of her desires.
