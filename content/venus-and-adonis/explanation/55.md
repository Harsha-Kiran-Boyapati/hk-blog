## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: "All swoln with chafing, down Adonis sits,"
*   **"All swoln with chafing"**: "Swoln" means swollen or puffed up. "Chafing" refers to irritation, vexation, or anger, often implying a sense of being rubbed raw or aggravated. Here, it describes Adonis's internal state of being inflamed with frustration and rage because his horse has bolted. Shakespeare uses this physical description to vividly convey Adonis's intense internal emotional state.
*   **Meaning:** Adonis, completely swollen with anger and irritation, sits down.

---

### Line 2: "Banning his boisterous and unruly beast:"
*   **"Banning"**: Cursing, denouncing, or wishing ill upon. It conveys Adonis's intense displeasure and verbal aggression towards his horse.
*   **"boisterous"**: Wild, noisy, unruly, and difficult to control. It emphasizes the horse's untamed nature, which has led to Adonis's current predicament.
*   **"unruly beast"**: Refers to Adonis's horse, which has disobeyed him by running off after the mare. The phrase highlights the animal's lack of discipline and Adonis's loss of control.
*   **Meaning:** Cursing his loud, wild, and disobedient horse.

---

### Line 3: "And now the happy season once more fits,"

Shakespeare uses capitalization to emphasize this personification.

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza marks a crucial turning point in *Venus and Adonis*, immediately following Adonis's failed pursuit of his runaway horse and the mare. Adonis's current state of frustrated anger ("All swoln with chafing") and immobility ("down Adonis sits") creates a window of opportunity for Venus. His furious "Banning his boisterous and unruly beast" signifies his distraction and vexation, effectively removing his previous means of escape (the horse) and rendering him vulnerable, or at least stationary, to Venus's advances.

The stanza then shifts from Adonis's physical and emotional state to Venus's strategic advantage. Lines 3 and 4 explicitly state that "the happy season once more fits" for "love-sick Love" (Venus) to resume her attempts at seduction through "pleading." This highlights Venus's relentless determination and her ability to seize any opportune moment.

The final two lines (5-6) provide a profound philosophical justification for Venus's continued verbose pursuit. The proverbial wisdom, "For lovers say, the heart hath treble wrong / When it is barr‚Äôd the aidance of the tongue," underscores a central theme of the poem: the persuasive power of language and the necessity of verbal expression in love. It argues that silence or the inability to communicate one's desires leads to profound suffering. This statement serves as a rationale for Venus's persistent and eloquent speeches throughout the poem; she implicitly understands that her only path to Adonis's affection is through the "aidance of the tongue."

In the broader context, this stanza transitions the narrative from a physical chase to a renewed battle of wits and words. It reinforces the themes of:
*   **Unrequited Love and Desire:** Venus's unwavering passion for Adonis.
*   **The Power of Rhetoric and Persuasion:** The stanza emphasizes that verbal communication is not merely decorative but essential for achieving romantic success and avoiding emotional "wrong."
*   **Opportunity and Seizing the Moment:** Venus's shrewdness in recognizing and exploiting Adonis's temporary weakness.
*   **Frustration and Impotence:** Adonis's anger at his uncontrollable horse mirrors his frustration with Venus's advances, but here, he is literally immobile and vulnerable to her verbal onslaught.

This stanza sets the stage for a new phase of intense verbal interaction, where Venus's "pleading" will continue to be a dominant force, even as Adonis remains resistant. It champions the spoken word as the primary vehicle for love's expression and fulfillment.
