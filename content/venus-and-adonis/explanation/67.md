## üìñ Original Stanza
```
‚ÄòWho sees his true-love in her naked bed,
Teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white,
But, when his glutton eye so full hath fed,
His other agents aim at like delight?       
Who is so faint, that dare not be so bold
To touch the fire, the weather being cold?
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: ‚ÄòWho sees his true-love in her naked bed,
*   **"Who"**: This serves as a rhetorical interrogative, implying an obvious answer of "no one" or "every man," thus setting up a universal claim. Shakespeare uses it to draw the reader into a shared understanding of common human experience.
*   **"true-love"**: Refers to a beloved or sweetheart, indicating an object of genuine affection. The term emphasizes the intimacy and emotional connection, making the ensuing desire seem natural and justified.
*   **"naked bed"**: Means unclothed in bed. "Naked" signifies vulnerability and complete exposure, while "bed" immediately sets a private, intimate, and sexually charged scene. Shakespeare chooses "naked bed" over simply "naked in bed" for its conciseness and to emphasize the bed as the context for this specific state of undress.
*   **Meaning:** "Who is there who sees his beloved unclothed in bed,"

### Line 2: Teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white,
*   **"Teaching the sheets"**: This is an example of personification, attributing the human action of "teaching" to inanimate sheets. It vividly conveys the overwhelming effect of Venus's radiant fairness.
*   **"a whiter hue than white"**: This is hyperbole, exaggerating Venus‚Äôs extreme whiteness and luminosity to an impossible degree. It suggests her skin is so brilliant and pure that it makes even white sheets appear dull or colored by comparison. Shakespeare uses this to emphasize Venus's divine beauty and alluring perfection, making her seem almost supernatural.
*   **Meaning:** "so luminous and fair that she makes the white bedsheets appear dull in comparison,"

---

### Line 3: But, when his glutton eye so full hath fed,
*   **"But"**: Introduces a consequential statement or a turning point in the rhetorical question, leading from observation to natural action.
*   **"his glutton eye"**: This is personification and a metaphor. The eye is personified as having an insatiable appetite, like a "glutton" who overeats. It metaphorically describes the intensity of visual desire, suggesting that merely looking at Venus is a form of consuming her beauty, but an unsatiating one. Shakespeare uses "glutton" to convey the powerful, almost uncontrollable, nature of visual lust.
*   **"so full hath fed"**: Means "has fed to satisfaction" or "has feasted fully." It indicates that the visual consumption of Venus's beauty has reached its peak, implying a transition from passive looking to active desire.
*   **Meaning:** "But when his greedy gaze has completely feasted upon her, and he has seen enough,"

---

### Line 4: His other agents aim at like delight?
*   **"His other agents"**: This is a euphemism and metaphor for the other parts of the body, particularly the sexual organs, or more broadly, the hands and limbs that would engage in physical intimacy. "Agents" implies they are instruments of desire, acting on behalf of the individual. Shakespeare chooses this formal and slightly detached term to refer to the body's parts driven by instinct.
*   **"aim at like delight"**: Means "seek a similar pleasure" or "desire a corresponding physical satisfaction." The "like delight" refers back to the pleasure derived from seeing the naked body, suggesting that visual arousal naturally leads to a desire for physical contact and sexual intimacy.
*   **Meaning:** "do not his other bodily senses and limbs then seek a similar physical pleasure?"

---

### Line 5: Who is so faint, that dare not be so bold
*   **"Who is so faint"**: Another rhetorical question, meaning "Who is so weak or cowardly?" "Faint" here implies a lack of courage, spirit, or vigor, directly challenging Adonis's perceived reluctance. Shakespeare uses this to frame resistance to natural desire as a moral failing or weakness.
*   **"dare not be so bold"**: Refers to lacking the courage or audacity to act upon the strong impulses generated by the previous lines. It's a direct challenge to the listener's (Adonis's) masculinity and natural inclinations.
*   **Meaning:** "Who is so weak-willed or lacking in courage that he would not dare to be so bold"

---

### Line 6: To touch the fire, the weather being cold?
*   **"To touch the fire"**: This is a powerful metaphor for engaging in passionate sexual acts or embracing the intense warmth of desire and love that Venus offers. "Fire" symbolizes heat, passion, danger, and consuming desire. Shakespeare employs "fire" for its immediate evocation of intense sensation and irresistible force.
*   **"the weather being cold"**: This is a contrasting metaphor. It implies circumstances that are uninviting, unpleasant, or lacking in warmth and comfort. It heightens the temptation to "touch the fire" by creating a context where warmth and passion would be especially desirable, thus making the choice to avoid it seem irrational. It could also suggest a general state of emotional coldness that passion could alleviate.
*   **Meaning:** "as to embrace passion, especially when circumstances are otherwise unappealing and yearning for warmth?"

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza is a central part of Venus's lengthy, passionate, and ultimately unsuccessful attempt to seduce Adonis. It encapsulates her fundamental argument about the naturalness and inevitability of sexual desire.

**Overall Meaning:** Venus employs a series of rhetorical questions to assert that it is a universal and undeniable truth that when a man sees his beloved naked and supremely beautiful, his visual arousal will inevitably lead to a desire for physical intimacy. She challenges Adonis's reluctance by framing resistance to this natural urge as a sign of weakness, cowardice, or an irrational denial of an appealing pleasure (the "fire") in the face of an unappealing alternative (the "cold weather"). She argues that it is human nature to seek warmth and pleasure when confronted with such intense beauty and opportunity.

**Significance in the Context of the Poem:**

*   **Conflict of Desires:** The stanza highlights the central conflict between Venus's ardent, mature, and sensual desire and Adonis's youthful, chaste, and nature-oriented (hunting) inclinations. It shows Venus's understanding of love as primarily physical and driven by instinct, a stark contrast to Adonis's disinterest.
*   **Venus's Persuasive Strategy:** It demonstrates Venus's reliance on rhetorical argument, appeals to universal experience, and subtle shaming tactics to persuade Adonis. She presents her desires as logical, natural, and unavoidable, attempting to corner Adonis into agreement. This highlights her role as the aggressive pursuer and rhetorician.
*   **The Power of Beauty and Sex:** The stanza underscores the intense power attributed to female beauty (Venus's radiant whiteness) to incite desire. It champions the idea that sexual urges are fundamental and irresistible human drives, making a powerful case for carnal love.
*   **Themes of Nature vs. Nurture/Control:** Venus's argument posits desire as a natural, instinctual force (like seeking warmth when cold). This contrasts with Adonis's apparent ability to control or suppress these urges, raising questions about whether desire is purely innate or can be tempered by reason or will.
*   **Sensuality and Imagery:** The vivid, sensual imagery (nakedness, radiant skin, gluttonous eye, fire) contributes significantly to the poem's overall erotic atmosphere, setting the tone for Venus's character and her relentless pursuit of Adonis.
