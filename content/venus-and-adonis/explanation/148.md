## üìñ Original Stanza
```
For now she knows it is no gentle chase,
But the blunt boar, rough bear, or lion proud,      
Because the cry remaineth in one place,
Wilere fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud:
Finding their enemy to be so curst,
They all strain courtesy who shall cope him first.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: "For now she knows it is no gentle chase,"
*   **"For now she knows"**: This indicates a shift in Venus's understanding; her previous vague fears are now hardening into certain knowledge due to the sounds she hears. "For" implies a reason or consequence.
*   **"no gentle chase"**: "Gentle" here means easy, harmless, or involving game that offers little resistance (like a deer or hare). The phrase signifies that this is not a leisurely or safe hunt, but one fraught with extreme danger. Shakespeare uses "gentle" to starkly contrast with the brutal reality that is about to be described.
*   **Meaning:** Because of what she hears, Venus now understands that this is not a harmless or easy hunt.

---

### Line 2: "But the blunt boar, rough bear, or lion proud,"
*   **"blunt boar"**: Refers to a wild boar, known for its formidable tusks and aggressive charge. "Blunt" emphasizes its heavy, forceful impact and unyielding nature, rather than a sharp edge, conveying brute strength and danger. Shakespeare chose "blunt" to suggest a powerful, unrefined, and dangerous force.
*   **"rough bear"**: Describes a bear, highlighting its shaggy, unkempt fur and its formidable, wild, and aggressive nature. "Rough" denotes its untamed and dangerous character.
*   **"lion proud"**: A lion, personified as "proud" to convey its inherent ferocity, dominance, and majestic yet deadly power as a predator. The "pride" here speaks to its savage might and supreme confidence in its own power.
*   **Meaning:** Instead, it's a dangerous confrontation with a powerful wild boar, a fierce bear, or a majestic but deadly lion.

---

### Line 3: "Because the cry remaineth in one place,"
*   **"the cry"**: Refers to the collective sounds made by the hunting dogs ‚Äì their barking, baying, and possibly the sounds of struggle.
*   **"remaineth in one place"**: This is the crucial detail that alerts Venus to the danger. If the hunted animal were fleeing, the sounds of the chase would move. The fact that the sounds are static indicates that the dogs have either cornered the animal, or the animal is standing its ground and fighting, signifying a direct, intense, and deadly confrontation rather than a pursuit.
*   **Meaning:** This realization comes because the loud sounds of the hunt (the dogs' cries) are staying in a single, fixed location.

---

### Line 4: "Where fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud:"
*   **"fearfully"**: This adverb highlights the dogs' state of mind. They are not merely barking excitedly; their cries are laced with fear, indicating the extreme danger posed by the cornered beast. This detail intensifies the perceived threat.
*   **"exclaim aloud"**: To cry out loudly, vehemently, or vociferously. "Exclaim" suggests a strong, urgent, and agitated outpouring of sound, emphasizing the dogs' distress and the severity of the situation.
*   **Meaning:** At that location, the dogs are barking loudly and nervously, showing their apprehension and distress.

---

### Line 5: "Finding their enemy to be so curst,"
*   **"Finding"**: Realizing or perceiving.
*   **"their enemy"**: The wild animal being hunted.
*   **"so curst"**: "Curst" here means extremely fierce, malicious, ill-tempered, or savage. It suggests a creature that is not just dangerous, but exceptionally aggressive and perhaps even malevolent in its resistance. Shakespeare uses "curst" to imbue the beast with an almost evil or exceptionally formidable nature, beyond mere animalistic aggression.
*   **Meaning:** Because they realize their opponent is so incredibly fierce and aggressive,

---

### Line 6: "They all strain courtesy who shall cope him first."
*   **"strain courtesy"**: This is a powerful ironic phrase. "Courtesy" implies politeness or deference, allowing someone else to go first. To "strain courtesy" means the dogs are comically and desperately trying to avoid being the first to engage, holding back and subtly pushing others forward. It‚Äôs an anthropomorphic depiction of their fear, highlighting the sheer terror the beast inspires.
*   **"cope him first"**: To confront, engage with, or contend with the animal first.
*   **Meaning:** They are all politely holding back, trying to get another dog to be the first one to confront the beast.

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza represents a crucial turning point in *Venus and Adonis*, marking Venus's transition from hopeful pursuit to a dawning, terrible understanding of Adonis's perilous situation. Her previous fears are now validated by the sounds of a hunt that is clearly not "gentle." The description of the dogs' "fearful" cries and their ironic "straining courtesy" vividly underscores the immense, untamed power of the wild beast they have cornered ‚Äì most notably, the "blunt boar" that will ultimately be Adonis's undoing.

In the broader context of the poem, this stanza is profoundly significant. It shatters any romanticized notions of the hunt, portraying it as a brutal, life-threatening confrontation rather than a noble sport. It powerfully foreshadows Adonis's tragic death, emphasizing the destructive force of nature that Venus, despite her divine power and desperate pleas, cannot control or prevent. The anthropomorphic depiction of the dogs' fear serves to magnify the beast's invincibility, making Adonis's likely demise all the more impactful. The stanza reinforces the poem's central themes: the inherent dangers of unchecked passion (Adonis's obsessive hunting, Venus's all-consuming lust) and the unyielding, often brutal, reality of nature that ultimately asserts its dominance over human or divine will. It highlights the tragic futility of attempting to impose desire or control upon the wild, untamed forces of the world.
