## üìñ Original Stanza
```
‚ÄòWhat am I that thou shouldst contemn me this?
Or what great danger dwells upon my suit?
What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss?
Speak, fair; but speak fair words, or else be mute:
Give me one kiss, I‚Äôll give it thee again,        
And one for interest if thou wilt have twain.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: ‚ÄòWhat am I that thou shouldst contemn me this?
*   **"contemn"**: This word means to treat with contempt, to scorn, or to reject disdainfully. Venus is expressing her bewilderment and indignation that Adonis would reject her or her advances in such a manner. Shakespeare chose this word to convey Venus's sense of insult and her inability to comprehend why she, a goddess of love, would be scorned.
*   **"me this"**: "This" refers to her offer of love, her physical presence, and her romantic overtures.
*   **Meaning:** "Who am I, a goddess of love, that you should treat me with such disdain by rejecting my advances?"

---

### Line 2: Or what great danger dwells upon my suit?
*   **"dwells upon"**: This means "is inherent in" or "accompanies." Venus is questioning what negative consequence or risk is associated with her request.
*   **"my suit"**: This refers to her plea, her romantic pursuit, or her courtship.
*   **Meaning:** "Or what significant danger is present in my request or in my pursuit of your affection?"

---

### Line 3: What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss?
*   **"the worse for"**: This phrase means to be harmed, damaged, or negatively affected by something.
*   **"poor kiss"**: "Poor" here emphasizes the smallness, simplicity, and perceived insignificance of the act, attempting to minimize any potential perceived harm or commitment.
*   **Meaning:** "How would your lips be harmed or made worse by giving me just one small kiss?"

---

### Line 4: Speak, fair; but speak fair words, or else be mute:
*   **"fair"**: Used here as a vocative, meaning "beautiful one." It's also a double entendre, hinting at "fair" as in just, pleasant, or agreeable.
*   **"speak fair words"**: This means to speak kindly, agreeably, or favorably; specifically, words that would accept her advances rather than rejecting them.
*   **"or else be mute"**: This is a direct, impatient command, implying that if he cannot speak words of acceptance or kindness, he should remain silent. It shows her growing frustration.
*   **Meaning:** "Speak, my beautiful one; but speak pleasant or agreeable words, or else remain silent."

---

### Line 5: Give me one kiss, I‚Äôll give it thee again,
*   **"give it thee again"**: This means she will return the kiss to him, implying reciprocity.
*   **Meaning:** "Give me one kiss, and I will kiss you back."

---

### Line 6: And one for interest if thou wilt have twain.
*   **"for interest"**: This is a financial metaphor, meaning an additional amount as a bonus or profit, like interest earned on a loan. She offers an extra kiss as a gain.
*   **"twain"**: An archaic word meaning "two."
*   **Meaning:** "And I will give you an additional kiss as a bonus, if you are willing to receive two in return (for your one)."

(Line 1)   | Emphasizes Venus's indignation and bewilderment at Adonis's rejection, highlighting the perceived lack of logical reason for his refusal and drawing the listener/reader into her perspective.                                                                                              |

| **Understatement / Minimization** | "What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss?" (Line 3) | Venus attempts to downplay the significance and potential impact of a kiss, presenting it as a trivial act with no negative consequences, thereby trying to break down Adonis's resistance by minimizing the perceived risk.                                                                 |

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

Stanza 35 marks a crucial shift in Venus's persuasive tactics. Having previously used logical arguments, flattery, and passionate appeals, she now resorts to a mix of bewildered indignation, minimizing the "cost" of her request, and finally, a direct command coupled with an overwhelmingly generous, almost transactional, offer. Her opening rhetorical questions express disbelief that she, a goddess, could be scorned, and that a simple kiss could pose any danger. This highlights her perception of love as a natural, harmless, and beneficial force.

The stanza is highly significant in its portrayal of Venus's unyielding desire and her increasing desperation. Her offer of a kiss "for interest" vividly illustrates her willingness to give far more than she asks for, reducing the sacred act of love to a quantifiable exchange, almost a commodity. This pragmatic, yet somewhat demeaning, approach underscores her immense frustration and her determination to break down Adonis's resistance by any means, even if it means presenting affection as a profitable venture.

In the broader context of "Venus and Adonis," this stanza sharpens the contrast between Venus's mature, assertive, and procreative love and Adonis's youthful, chaste, and nature-oriented purity. Her inability to comprehend his rejection, despite her power and beauty, sets the stage for the tragic irony that follows: Adonis's avoidance of love ultimately leads to his demise, emphasizing the poem's themes of the destructive power of unrequited passion, the transient nature of beauty, and the ultimate victory of Venus's domain (though not with Adonis himself) as his blood transforms into the anemone, forever linked to her sorrow. The stanza also contributes to the poem's exploration of persuasion, desire, and the often-futile pursuit of an unwilling beloved.
