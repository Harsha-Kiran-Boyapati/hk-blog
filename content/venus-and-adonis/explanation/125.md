‚ÄòAnd not the least of all these maladies
But in one minute‚Äôs fight brings beauty under:

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: ‚ÄòAnd not the least of all these maladies
*   **"not the least of all these maladies"**: This phrase emphasizes that even the most minor or seemingly insignificant among the destructive forces or harms (maladies) being discussed has a profound and devastating impact. "Maladies" here refers to the injuries, sicknesses, or violent harms that the boar is capable of inflicting. Shakespeare uses this to underscore the overwhelming power of the threat.
*   **Meaning:** "And even the slightest among these destructive harms or injuries"

---

### Line 2: But in one minute‚Äôs fight brings beauty under:
*   **"But"**: In this archaic usage, "but" means "which does not" or "that does not fail to".
*   **"one minute‚Äôs fight"**: This phrase highlights the extreme speed and suddenness with which beauty can be destroyed. It emphasizes the brevity of the struggle and the immediacy of the outcome.
*   **"brings beauty under"**: This is a powerful personification of "beauty," depicting it as something that can be subdued, defeated, or utterly destroyed. It implies that beauty, despite its allure, is vulnerable to the destructive force.
*   **Meaning:** "Cannot fail, in a single minute's conflict, to utterly subdue and destroy beauty:"

---

### Line 3: Both favour, savour hue, and qualities,
*   **"favour"**: In this context, "favour" refers to a person's physical appearance, features, or attractiveness. It encompasses the grace and pleasing aspect of their countenance.
*   **"savour"**: While often meaning 'taste', here "savour" implies the pleasant aroma or delightful essence that emanates from a person's vitality and appeal. It suggests a comprehensive sensory attractiveness beyond just sight.
*   **"hue"**: This refers to the color of the skin, complexion, or healthy glow, particularly the vibrant flush of youth and health.
*   **"qualities"**: This is a broad term encompassing all the inherent characteristics, attributes, virtues, and excellences that make a person desirable and admirable, both physically and perhaps even their inherent good nature. Shakespeare uses this accumulation to paint a complete picture of Adonis's perfection.
*   **Meaning:** "Both his physical attractiveness, his delightful essence, his healthy complexion, and all his inherent virtues,"

---

### Line 4: Whereat the impartial gazer late did wonder,
*   **"Whereat"**: This means "at which" or "at the sight of which."
*   **"impartial gazer"**: This refers to any objective observer, a person looking without bias or personal attachment. The implication is that Adonis's beauty is so universally striking that anyone, even a neutral onlooker, would be captivated by it. This elevates his beauty beyond Venus's subjective adoration.
*   **"late did wonder"**: "Late" here means "recently" or "just a short time ago." "Did wonder" means felt awe, astonishment, or admiration. This creates a stark contrast between the recent past (when his beauty was admired) and the imminent or sudden destruction.
*   **Meaning:** "At which any objective observer recently felt immense admiration and awe,"

---

### Line 5: Are on the sudden wasted, thaw‚Äôd and done,
*   **"on the sudden"**: This archaic phrase means "suddenly," "abruptly," or "unexpectedly." It emphasizes the rapid and unforeseen nature of the destruction.
*   **"wasted"**: Here, "wasted" means completely destroyed, ruined, or consumed. It conveys a sense of utter devastation and loss.
*   **"thaw‚Äôd"**: This word means "melted" or "dissolved." It introduces the imagery of melting, directly foreshadowing and connecting to the simile in the next line. It suggests a complete dissolution, a loss of form and substance, leaving nothing behind.
*   **"done"**: In this context, "done" means utterly finished, completed, undone, or destroyed. It signifies finality and utter annihilation.
*   **Meaning:** "Are abruptly ruined, dissolved as if melted, and utterly destroyed,"

---

### Line 6: As mountain-snow melts with the mid-day sun.
*   **"As mountain-snow melts with the mid-day sun"**: This is a powerful and vivid simile. It compares the rapid, complete, and seemingly effortless disappearance of beauty to the swift melting of snow on a mountain under the intense heat of the mid-day sun. It highlights the extreme fragility and transience of beauty when confronted with a powerful, destructive force, emphasizing the inevitability and speed of its demise.
*   **Meaning:** "Just as mountain snow melts away under the intense heat of the mid-day sun."

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza is a powerful expression of Venus's desperate plea to Adonis to abandon the hunt, serving as a dire prophecy of his impending death. It encapsulates her central argument about the fragility and transience of beauty and life when confronted by the brutal, destructive forces of nature, specifically personified by the wild boar.

The stanza's core message is the extreme vulnerability of exquisite beauty to sudden and total annihilation. Venus emphasizes that even the slightest touch of harm ("not the least of all these maladies") can utterly devastate and erase all facets of attractiveness ("favour, savour hue, and qualities") in an instant ("one minute's fight"). The use of the "impartial gazer" highlights that Adonis's beauty is not just a lover's biased view but a universally acknowledged perfection, making its potential loss all the more tragic.

The culminating simile of melting mountain snow vividly illustrates the complete and irreversible dissolution of this beauty. It transforms an abstract concept into a concrete, natural process, underscoring the swiftness, completeness, and inevitability of decay when confronted with a powerful force (the "mid-day sun" representing the destructive boar).

In the broader context of *Venus and Adonis*, this stanza is profoundly significant:
*   **Foreshadowing and Dramatic Irony:** It acts as a clear premonition of Adonis's death. The audience knows, or at least suspects, his tragic fate, making Venus's words laden with dramatic irony and pathos.
*   **Theme of Fragility and Mortality:** It reinforces one of the poem's central themes: the transient nature of beauty and the inevitability of death. Unlike Venus, who is immortal, Adonis is mortal, and his youth and beauty are subject to decay and destruction. This mirrors the broader Elizabethan concern with time and mortality, often explored in Shakespeare's sonnets.
*   **Conflict of Love vs. Lust/Violence:** Venus's pure, protective love for Adonis (which seeks to preserve his beauty and life) is starkly contrasted with Adonis's passion for the hunt, which represents a raw, destructive force. The stanza frames the hunt as a direct threat to the very essence of what Venus loves.
*   **The Power of Nature:** The boar, as a force of untamed nature, is depicted as capable of dismantling even the most perfect human form, emphasizing humanity's ultimate vulnerability to the natural world.

Ultimately, this stanza is a pivotal moment where Venus articulates the core danger inherent in Adonis's chosen pursuit, encapsulating the poem's tragic arc and its meditation on beauty, mortality, and the destructive potential of uncontrolled passion.
