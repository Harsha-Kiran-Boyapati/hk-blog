## üìñ Original Stanza
```
'Who wears a garment shapeless and unfinish'd?
Who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth?       
If springing things be any jot diminish'd,
They wither in their prime, prove nothing worth;
The colt that's back'd and burden'd being young
Loseth his pride, and never waxeth strong.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: "'Who wears a garment shapeless and unfinish'd?"
*   **"Who wears a garment"**: Venus asks rhetorically who would choose to wear clothing. This is an appeal to common sense and practical behavior.
*   **"shapeless and unfinish'd"**: Clothing that has no proper form and is incomplete. This describes something that hasn't reached its intended final state‚Äîit's still in process, unready for use.
*   **Meaning:** "Who would wear clothing that has no proper shape and isn't completed?"

---

### Line 2: "Who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth?"
*   **"Who plucks the bud"**: Who picks or harvests a flower bud. "Pluck" suggests forceful removal, taking something before its time.
*   **"before one leaf put forth"**: Before even a single leaf has emerged or developed. This emphasizes extreme prematurity‚Äîthe plant hasn't even begun to show signs of growth.
*   **Meaning:** "Who picks a flower bud before it has even grown a single leaf?"

---

### Line 3: "If springing things be any jot diminish'd,"
*   **"springing things"**: Growing things, plants and creatures in their early stages of development. "Springing" suggests the vigorous growth of spring.
*   **"be any jot diminish'd"**: Are reduced or harmed even slightly. "Jot" means a tiny amount‚Äîeven the smallest interference can be damaging.
*   **Meaning:** "If growing things are harmed even slightly,"

---

### Line 4: "They wither in their prime, prove nothing worth;"
*   **"They wither in their prime"**: They dry up and die during what should be their best period. "Prime" refers to the peak time of beauty and strength.
*   **"prove nothing worth"**: Turn out to be worthless, become useless. The damage in youth makes them fail to achieve their potential value.
*   **Meaning:** "They will die during their best years and become worthless;"

---

### Line 5: "The colt that's back'd and burden'd being young"
*   **"The colt"**: A young horse, specifically a young male horse. This continues Venus's use of horse imagery from the previous episodes.
*   **"back'd and burden'd"**: Saddled and loaded with weight for work. "Backed" means having a saddle put on; "burdened" means loaded with heavy cargo.
*   **"being young"**: While still in youth, before reaching maturity. This emphasizes the premature nature of the treatment.
*   **Meaning:** "The young horse that is saddled and loaded with burdens while still immature"

---

### Line 6: "Loseth his pride, and never waxeth strong."
*   **"Loseth his pride"**: Loses his dignity, his natural confidence and beauty. "Pride" here refers to the natural bearing and spirit of a healthy animal.
*   **"never waxeth strong"**: Never grows to be powerful. "Waxeth" is archaic for "grows" or "becomes." The early burden prevents full development.
*   **Meaning:** "Loses his natural dignity and never grows to be strong."

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza presents Venus's most sophisticated argument against premature sexual experience‚Äîironically undermining her own pursuit of the young Adonis. She uses natural and practical metaphors to argue that early interference with development leads to permanent damage.

**The Paradox of Venus's Argument**: Venus argues against premature sexual experience while simultaneously trying to seduce a youth. This creates dramatic irony‚Äîher logical argument contradicts her own behavior, revealing the inconsistency in her approach.

**Natural Development Theory**: Venus presents a philosophy that natural things need time to develop fully before being "used." This reflects Renaissance ideas about the proper timing of human development and the dangers of rushing natural processes.

**Practical Wisdom vs. Desire**: The stanza shows Venus capable of wise counsel when it serves her argument, but her desire overrides her wisdom when it conflicts with her goals.

**Universal Principles**: The rhetorical questions appeal to universal experiences‚Äîeveryone knows you don't wear unfinished clothes or pick unopened buds. This makes her argument seem obviously correct.

**Economic Language**: Terms like "nothing worth" introduce economic thinking‚Äîpremature use destroys value. This practical argument might appeal to Adonis more than emotional pleas.

**The Colt Metaphor**: The image of the overburdened young horse directly parallels Adonis's situation‚ÄîVenus is trying to "burden" him with adult sexual responsibility before he's ready.

**Permanent Damage**: Venus argues that early interference causes permanent harm ("never waxeth strong"), suggesting that sexual experience too young would damage Adonis forever.

**Self-Defeating Logic**: By making this argument, Venus inadvertently makes the case against her own seduction attempt. If premature sexual experience is harmful, then she should leave Adonis alone.

**Adonis's Counter-Argument**: This stanza provides Adonis with the perfect logical foundation for rejecting Venus‚Äîhe can use her own reasoning to justify his resistance.

**Gender and Power**: The metaphor of the "backed and burdened" colt reflects concerns about sexual submission and domination, with Venus unconsciously positioning herself as the one who would "burden" Adonis.

This stanza demonstrates Shakespeare's psychological insight‚ÄîVenus is so focused on winning her argument that she doesn't realize she's arguing against herself. It shows how desire can make even intelligent people contradict their own best judgment.
