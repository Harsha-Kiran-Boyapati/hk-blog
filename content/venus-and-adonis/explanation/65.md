## üìñ Original Stanza
```
Thus she replies: ‚ÄòThy palfrey, as he should,
Welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire:
Affection is a coal that must be cool‚Äôd;
Else, suffer‚Äôd, it will set the heart on fire:      
The sea hath bounds, but deep desire hath none;
Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: 'Thy palfrey, as he should,
*   **"Thy palfrey"**: "Thy" is an archaic form of "your." A "palfrey" is a specific type of horse, typically a smaller, gentler riding horse, often used by ladies or for ceremonial purposes. Here, it refers to Adonis's horse, which has run off. Shakespeare uses this specific term to evoke a sense of refinement, contrasting later with the horse's primal instinct.
*   **"as he should"**: This phrase suggests that the horse's actions are natural, expected, and even proper given its inherent nature. Venus uses this to imply that following natural instinct (especially sexual instinct) is an appropriate course of action, laying the groundwork for her argument about her own desires.
*   **Meaning:** "Your horse, behaving exactly as it naturally should,"

### Line 2: Welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire:
*   **"Welcomes"**: Actively receives or embraces, indicating a positive and willing response. Shakespeare uses "welcomes" to emphasize the voluntary and natural inclination of the horse towards its mate, rather than merely "reacts to."
*   **"the warm approach"**: Refers to the drawing near of the mare, imbued with a sense of heat and passion due to the imminent sexual encounter. "Warm" directly relates to the rising passion and physical heat associated with desire.
*   **"of sweet desire"**: "Sweet" here is ironic or refers to the alluring, pleasurable aspect of sexual longing. "Desire" specifically means sexual passion or lust. Venus attributes this human-like "sweetness" to the animal's instinct, drawing a direct parallel between the horse's natural urge and her own "sweet" passion for Adonis.
*   **Meaning:** "Actively embraces the passionate arrival of sexual longing:"

---

### Line 3: Affection is a coal that must be cool‚Äôd;
*   **"Affection"**: Here, "affection" refers to intense passion, love, or lust. In Shakespeare's time, it could carry a stronger connotation of passionate love than in modern usage.
*   **"is a coal"**: This is a direct metaphor. A "coal" (an ember or burning piece of fuel) signifies heat, intensity, and potential for combustion or spreading. Shakespeare uses this to illustrate that passion, like a coal, contains inherent heat and energy, and if left unattended, it can become uncontrollable and destructive.
*   **"that must be cool‚Äôd"**: This implies that such intense passion, if allowed to burn unchecked, is dangerous and needs to be tempered, extinguished, or satisfied. Venus is arguing that her passion needs an outlet, implicitly Adonis himself, to be "cooled" or contained.
*   **Meaning:** "Such intense passion is like a burning ember that must be quenched;"

---

### Line 4: Else, suffer‚Äôd, it will set the heart on fire:
*   **"Else"**: Otherwise.
*   **"suffer‚Äôd"**: If permitted, allowed to continue, or indulged. This implies a choice to either manage or let the passion run wild.
*   **"it will set the heart on fire"**: A common idiom for consuming, intense emotional or passionate arousal, often with connotations of torment or destructive obsession. Shakespeare uses this vivid imagery to reinforce the idea that unchecked desire leads to overwhelming, possibly agonizing, internal turmoil.
*   **Meaning:** "Otherwise, if allowed to persist, it will cause extreme emotional turmoil and burning passion in the heart:"

---

### Line 5: The sea hath bounds, but deep desire hath none;
*   **"The sea hath bounds"**: "Hath" is an archaic form of "has." Even the vast, powerful ocean has limits, shores, and defined boundaries. This serves as a tangible example of something immense yet finite.
*   **"but deep desire hath none"**: In stark contrast, intense, profound desire (especially sexual passion) is presented as boundless, limitless, and uncontrollable. Shakespeare uses this hyperbole to emphasize the overwhelming, insatiable nature of passion, arguing that it is a force beyond earthly limitations, thus justifying its pursuit.
*   **Meaning:** "Even the vast ocean has its limits, but profound desire has absolutely no boundaries;"

---

### Line 6: Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone.
*   **"Therefore"**: For this reason; consequently. This marks the conclusion of Venus's logical (from her perspective) argument.
*   **"no marvel"**: No surprise; no wonder. "Marvel" refers to something astonishing or a cause for wonder. Venus asserts that the outcome is entirely predictable given the nature of desire.
*   **"though thy horse be gone"**: Although your horse has run off. This directly links her abstract philosophical argument about desire back to the concrete situation of Adonis's horse, completing the analogy. She implies that just as his horse's departure was driven by irresistible, natural desire, so too is her relentless pursuit of him.
*   **Meaning:** "Therefore, it's no surprise at all that your horse has run off."

| **Juxtaposition/Contrast** | "The sea hath bounds, but deep desire hath none" (Line 5) | Contrasts the physically vast yet finite sea with the abstract, infinite nature of desire, emphasizing desire's overwhelming and limitless power.                          |
| **Figurative Language/Idiom** | "set the heart on fire" (Line 4)                     | A common idiom for intense, consuming passion, reinforcing the idea of desire as a powerful, potentially overwhelming or even destructive force.                       |

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza is a pivotal moment in Venus's relentless attempt to seduce Adonis. Through an elaborate and rhetorically skilled argument, she uses the concrete situation of Adonis's missing horse to deliver a persuasive and philosophical exposition on the nature of desire.

**Overall Meaning:** Venus asserts that Adonis's horse running off to mate is no surprise, as it merely followed its natural, uncontainable instinct. She extends this analogy to human passion, declaring that "affection" (intense desire or lust) is like a "coal" that, if not "cool'd" (satisfied or released), will "set the heart on fire." She emphasizes that while even the sea has limits, "deep desire hath none," portraying it as a boundless, irresistible force. Her underlying message is that her own powerful desire for Adonis is just as natural and uncontrollable as the horse's instinctual drive, and therefore, it should be fulfilled rather than resisted.

**Significance in the Context of the Poem:**

*   **Theme of Nature vs. Chastity/Reason:** This stanza directly engages with the poem's central conflict. Venus champions the natural, instinctual, and passionate side of existence, using the horse's behavior as an example of nature's undeniable call. She implicitly argues that Adonis's resistance to her advances is unnatural and contrary to the very essence of life and desire.
*   **Venus's Persuasive Rhetoric:** The stanza highlights Venus's formidable persuasive abilities. She doesn't merely beg or demand; she constructs a logical (from her perspective) argument, using vivid metaphors, analogies, and a seemingly irrefutable truth about desire to manipulate Adonis's understanding of his own situation and of her advances. This demonstrates her agency and the force of her will.
*   **The Boundless Nature of Desire:** The declaration "deep desire hath none" is a core thematic statement for the poem. It encapsulates the unquenchable, often overwhelming, and sometimes destructive force of passion that drives much of the narrative. While Venus uses it to justify her advances, this boundless nature can also foreshadow the potential for obsession and sorrow that later emerges in the poem.
*   **Reversal of Traditional Gender Roles:** Venus, as the active pursuer, defies Elizabethan societal norms. Her assertion of boundless desire is a powerful declaration of female sexual agency, challenging the passive role typically expected of women in courtship. She frames her desire as an inherent, natural force, not a mere whim.
