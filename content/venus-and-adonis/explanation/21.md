```
‚ÄòArt thou asham‚Äôd to kiss? then wink again,
And I will wink; so shall the day seem night;
Love keeps his revels where there are but twain;
Be bold to play, our sport is not in sight:
These blue-vein‚Äôd violets whereon we lean
Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: ‚ÄòArt thou asham‚Äôd to kiss? then wink again,
*   **"Art thou asham'd to kiss?"**: Venus directly confronts Adonis about his reluctance, questioning if shyness or modesty is preventing him from kissing her. This highlights Adonis's youth and inexperience contrasted with Venus's forwardness.
*   **"then wink again"**: Venus suggests a playful solution: if Adonis closes his eyes, he won't feel embarrassed or see her, making the act of kissing potentially easier for him. It's a clever, sensual invitation disguised as a remedy for shyness.
*   **Meaning:** "Are you too shy to kiss me? Then just close your eyes again,"

---

### Line 2: And I will wink; so shall the day seem night;
*   **"And I will wink"**: Venus promises to reciprocate, closing her own eyes. This gesture implies shared intimacy and vulnerability, creating a mutual agreement for privacy.
*   **"so shall the day seem night"**: This is a metaphorical statement. By both closing their eyes, they create a personal, private darkness, effectively transforming the bright day into a night-like atmosphere. Night is traditionally associated with secrecy, uninhibited passion, and freedom from observation, making it an ideal setting for their desired intimacy.
*   **Meaning:** "And I will close my eyes too; that way, the daytime will feel like nighttime;"

---

### Line 3: Love keeps his revels where there are but twain;
*   **"Love keeps his revels"**: "Revels" refers to lively celebrations or festivities. Here, Love is personified as a deity or entity that holds its most joyous celebrations. This suggests that true, uninhibited passion requires a specific environment.
*   **"where there are but twain"**: "Twain" means two. The phrase asserts that Love's truest and most passionate expressions (its "revels") occur only in absolute privacy, when just two lovers are present, away from any onlookers or distractions. This underscores Venus's argument for intimacy and discretion.
*   **Meaning:** "Love holds its most joyous celebrations only when there are just two people present;"

---

### Line 4: Be bold to play, our sport is not in sight:
*   **"Be bold to play"**: Venus directly encourages Adonis to be courageous and participate in their romantic "game." "Play" here refers to their amorous interaction, suggesting flirtation and potentially physical intimacy.
*   **"our sport is not in sight"**: "Sport" in this context refers to their amorous activity or lovemaking. Venus assures Adonis that no one can observe them, removing any reason for shame or apprehension. This reiterates the theme of absolute privacy and secrecy crucial to her persuasion.
*   **Meaning:** "Be brave and engage in our love-making, as no one can see us:"

---

### Line 5: These blue-vein‚Äôd violets whereon we lean
*   **"These blue-vein'd violets"**: A vivid piece of natural imagery, describing the delicate beauty of the violets with their visible "veins" (petals or stems), which might subtly echo the veins on human skin. It highlights their close proximity to the natural world.
*   **"whereon we lean"**: This detail grounds them physically in the setting, emphasizing their immediate surroundings and the natural, pastoral environment in which Venus is attempting to seduce Adonis.
*   **Meaning:** "These delicate violets with visible blue veins, on which we are currently leaning,"

---

### Line 6: Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.
*   **"Never can blab"**: "Blab" means to reveal secrets or gossip. Venus personifies the violets, declaring that they are incapable of speaking or betraying their intimate moments. This reinforces the absolute privacy and secrecy of their encounter.
*   **"nor know not what we mean"**: This is a double negative ("nor know not"), which serves to emphasize the positive assertion: "they also do not know what we mean." The flowers are presented as uncomprehending and inanimate, further assuring Adonis that their actions will remain utterly private and unjudged.
*   **Meaning:** "Can never tell our secrets, nor do they even understand what we are doing."

| **Euphemism**      | "our sport"                            | Softens the direct reference to sexual activity, making it seem more playful and less overtly demanding, which might be more palatable to the modest Adonis.                                                                                                                                  |

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza is a pivotal moment in Venus's relentless pursuit of Adonis, showcasing her sophisticated persuasive tactics. Unable to elicit a kiss directly, she shifts her strategy from overt seduction to reassuring Adonis about the absolute privacy and discretion of their potential interaction.

The overall meaning of the stanza is Venus's fervent attempt to convince Adonis that there is no shame, no risk of exposure, and every reason to embrace physical love with her. She addresses his shyness directly ("Art thou asham'd to kiss?") and offers a playful solution (closing eyes to make "day seem night"), which metaphorically creates a private, unobserved world for them. Her argument hinges on the idea that "Love keeps his revels where there are but twain," emphasizing that true passion flourishes only in complete secrecy between two individuals. She further bolsters this by reassuring him that "our sport is not in sight," and even the natural elements around them‚Äîthe "blue-vein'd violets"‚Äîare incapable of "blab[bing]" or understanding their intentions.

In the broader context of *Venus and Adonis*, this stanza highlights several key themes:

1.  **The Nature of Love and Desire:** Venus embodies carnal, assertive love, contrasting sharply with Adonis's youthful innocence and preference for chaste pursuits (like hunting). Her persuasive arguments here are a core representation of the poem's exploration of desire, its irresistible force, and the lengths to which it will go.
2.  **Persuasion and Rhetoric:** This stanza exemplifies Venus's powerful rhetorical skills. She uses logic, flattery, reassurance, and vivid imagery to break down Adonis's resistance. Her arguments about privacy are central to her seduction, as she understands that Adonis's reluctance stems from modesty or aversion to public display.
3.  **Nature as a Setting for Intimacy:** The pastoral setting (the violets) is not just a backdrop but an active participant in Venus's argument. By personifying the flowers as incapable of betraying secrets, she attempts to use nature itself as a silent accomplice, reinforcing the idea of a safe, private space for their love. This contrasts with the poem's later depiction of nature as indifferent or even hostile to human desires.
4.  **Innocence vs. Experience:** The stanza directly confronts the clash between Adonis's virginity and Venus's seasoned desire. Her reassurances are designed to overcome his inexperience and shyness, demonstrating the gap between their understanding and approach to love.

Ultimately, this stanza is crucial in advancing Venus's campaign, demonstrating her strategic mind and the lengths she will go to achieve her amorous goals, while simultaneously setting the stage for Adonis's continued, yet ultimately futile, resistance.
