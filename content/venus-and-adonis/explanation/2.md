## üìñ Original Stanza
‚ÄòThrice fairer than myself,‚Äô thus she began,
‚ÄòThe field‚Äôs chief flower, sweet above compare,

Nature that made thee, with herself at strife,
Saith that the world hath ending with thy life.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: "‚ÄòThrice fairer than myself,‚Äô thus she began,"

*   **"Thrice fairer than myself"**: Venus claims Adonis is three times more beautiful than she is - an extraordinary claim from the goddess of beauty herself. This hyperbolic praise establishes the intensity of her desire and the exceptional nature of Adonis's beauty.
*   **"thus she began"**: Indicates the start of Venus's direct speech and seductive rhetoric, marking the transition from narrative to her persuasive discourse.
*   **Meaning:** "You are three times more beautiful than I am," Venus began to say.

---
### Line 2: "‚ÄòThe field‚Äôs chief flower, sweet above compare,"

*   **"The field's chief flower"**: A metaphor comparing Adonis to the most beautiful flower in all the fields - the supreme bloom among all natural beauty.
*   **"sweet above compare"**: His sweetness (both physical beauty and character) is beyond comparison; nothing can match it. "Sweet" carries connotations of both physical attractiveness and pleasant nature.
*   **Meaning:** "The most beautiful flower in all the fields, sweet beyond comparison."

---
### Line 3: "Stain to all nymphs, more lovely than a man,"

*   **"Stain to all nymphs"**: A paradoxical phrase meaning he makes all nymphs (female nature spirits known for beauty) appear stained or diminished by comparison. His beauty makes even these traditionally beautiful beings seem flawed.
*   **"more lovely than a man"**: His beauty transcends typical masculine appearance, possessing a loveliness usually associated with feminine beauty but enhanced beyond it.
*   **Meaning:** "You make all nymphs appear flawed by comparison, and you're more lovely than any ordinary man."

---
### Line 4: "More white and red than doves or roses are;"

*   **"More white and red"**: Refers to his complexion - the ideal Renaissance beauty standard of fair skin with rosy cheeks and lips.
*   **"than doves or roses are"**: Comparison to doves (pure white) and roses (perfect red) - classic symbols of purity and passion. He surpasses even these natural standards of color perfection.
*   **Meaning:** "Your complexion is more perfectly white and red than doves or roses."

---
### Line 5: "Nature that made thee, with herself at strife,"

*   **"Nature that made thee"**: Personifies Nature as the creator of Adonis, emphasizing the divine/natural origin of his beauty.
*   **"with herself at strife"**: Nature is in conflict with herself - she has created something so perfect that it challenges her own creative powers and creates internal discord.
*   **Meaning:** "Nature, who created you, is in conflict with herself."

---
### Line 6: "Saith that the world hath ending with thy life."

*   **"Saith"**: Archaic form of "says" - Nature declares or proclaims.
*   **"the world hath ending with thy life"**: Nature proclaims that the world will end when Adonis dies, because his beauty is so supreme that without it, the world loses its purpose and perfection.
*   **Meaning:** "Says that the world will end when your life ends."

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza presents Venus's opening argument in her seduction of Adonis, establishing the central theme of overwhelming, idealized beauty. Venus's speech reveals several key elements: her recognition of beauty that surpasses even her own divine perfection, the hyperbolic nature of desire that sees the beloved as transcending all natural comparison, and the cosmic significance she attributes to Adonis's existence.

The stanza is crucial because it establishes the power dynamic - Venus, despite being a goddess, positions herself as the suppliant, acknowledging Adonis's superior beauty. This reversal of expected divine hierarchy shows how beauty can overthrow even divine power. The imagery moves from comparative ("thrice fairer") to superlative ("sweet above compare") to cosmic ("world hath ending"), escalating the stakes of the encounter.

Shakespeare uses this stanza to explore themes of idealized love, the power of physical beauty, and the hyperbolic nature of passionate desire. The Renaissance aesthetic ideals (white and red complexion) are presented but then transcended. The stanza also introduces the tragic undertone with the reference to Adonis's eventual death, foreshadowing the poem's conclusion while emphasizing the temporary, precious nature of such perfect beauty.
