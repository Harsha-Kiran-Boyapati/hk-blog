```
She marking them, begins a wailing note,
And sings extemporally a woeful ditty;      
How love makes young men thrall and old men dote;
How love is wise in folly foolish-witty:
Her heavy anthem still concludes in woe,
And still the choir of echoes answer so.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: She marking them, begins a wailing note,
*   **"She marking them"**: Venus, after discovering Adonis dead alongside the boar, is observing or taking notice of them. "Marking" here means to perceive or observe closely.
*   **"begins a wailing note"**: She starts to utter a mournful, sorrowful sound, indicating the immediate onset of intense grief.
*   **Meaning:** "Venus, seeing the dead bodies, starts to cry out in mournful lament."

---

### Line 2: And sings extemporally a woeful ditty;
*   **"sings extemporally"**: She sings spontaneously, without any prior preparation or thought, driven by the overwhelming force of her emotion. This emphasizes the raw and immediate nature of her grief.
*   **"a woeful ditty"**: A sad, sorrowful, or lamenting song. A "ditty" is typically a short, simple song, but here it conveys the profound sadness of her impromptu composition.
*   **Meaning:** "And spontaneously begins to sing a sorrowful song."

---

### Line 3: How love makes young men thrall and old men dote;
*   **"How love makes young men thrall"**: Love enslaves or subjugates young men, making them captives to its power and desires, often against their better judgment. "Thrall" means in bondage or enslaved.
*   **"and old men dote"**: Love causes older men to become foolishly infatuated or obsessively fond, often leading to undignified or irrational behavior. "Dote" suggests uncritical affection or senile obsession.
*   **Meaning:** "How love makes young men enslaved and old men foolishly infatuated."

---

### Line 4: How love is wise in folly foolish-witty:
*   **"How love is wise in folly"**: This is a paradox. Love appears to possess wisdom or cunning, but its actions or outcomes are inherently foolish, irrational, or destructive. It's a cleverness applied to foolish pursuits.
*   **"foolish-witty"**: Another oxymoron, compounding the paradox. Love has a kind of cleverness or sharp intelligence ("witty"), but this wit is directed towards or results in foolish ends. It's cunningly absurd or cleverly misguided.
*   **Meaning:** "How love, despite seeming clever, is actually foolish, and its cleverness leads to foolish outcomes."

---

### Line 5: Her heavy anthem still concludes in woe,
*   **"Her heavy anthem"**: Her profound, solemn, and sorrowful lament. "Anthem" suggests a formal or ceremonial song, elevating her spontaneous ditty into a weighty declaration, while "heavy" emphasizes its somber and serious nature.
*   **"still concludes in woe"**: Always, continually, or invariably ends in great sorrow, grief, or misfortune. This reflects Venus's bitter realization about the ultimate outcome of love.
*   **Meaning:** "Her profound lament always ends in sorrow."

---

### Line 6: And still the choir of echoes answer so.
*   **"And still the choir of echoes"**: And always, continuously, the collective, unified sound of the echoes. "Choir" personifies the echoes, giving them a harmonious, almost choral voice, as if they are joining in her lament.
*   **"answer so"**: The echoes respond in the same manner, repeating or affirming her woeful pronouncements. This amplifies her grief and suggests its universal or inescapable nature.
*   **Meaning:** "And the collective sound of the echoes always responds in agreement with her sorrow."

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza marks a pivotal moment in *Venus and Adonis*, signaling Venus's shift from active pursuit and passionate desire to profound lament and bitter reflection. After the devastating discovery of Adonis's death, Venus's overwhelming grief transforms into a spontaneously uttered "woeful ditty"‚Äîa sorrowful song that articulates her newly solidified, cynical view of love.

The core meaning of the stanza lies in Venus's realization (or re-affirmation) that love, despite its allure, is fundamentally destructive and leads to "woe." She portrays love not as a joyous union, but as a manipulative force that "makes young men thrall" (enslaves them) and "old men dote" (makes them foolishly obsessed). This highlights love's power to strip individuals of their agency and dignity, reducing them to its captives or infatuated victims.

The paradoxical description of love as "wise in folly foolish-witty" is crucial. It suggests that love operates with a cunning, almost intelligent, deception, yet its ultimate ends are irrational, absurd, and heartbreaking. This reflects Venus's own recent experience: her passionate, "wise" pursuit of Adonis led directly to his "foolish" and tragic death. The stanza effectively argues that love's cleverness is a treacherous quality, leading to ruin rather than happiness.

The "heavy anthem" that "still concludes in woe" underscores the inevitable tragic outcome that Venus now associates with love. The personified "choir of echoes" that "answer so" further universalizes this lament. The echoes' affirmation suggests that her sorrow is not unique but a fundamental truth about love, one that is echoed throughout nature and time.

In the broader context of the poem, this stanza serves as a dark summation of the poem's narrative arc. The initial vibrant, almost comical, depiction of Venus's unbridled desire and pursuit now culminates in a deep understanding of passion's destructive potential. It moves the poem beyond the immediate tragedy of Adonis's death to a more philosophical, albeit despairing, statement about the nature of love itself. This lament sets the stage for Venus's subsequent actions, particularly her curse on love, which profoundly alters its nature in the world, forever mingling it with sorrow and jealousy. The stanza thus functions as a powerful turning point, transforming Venus from a desirous goddess into a grieving prophetess of love's inherent pain.
