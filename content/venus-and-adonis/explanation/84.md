## üìñ Original Stanza
```
‚ÄòO! thou didst kill me; kill me once again:
Thy eyes‚Äô shrewd tutor, that hard heart of thine,   
Hath taught them scornful tricks, and such disdain,
That they have murder‚Äôd this poor heart of mine;
And these mine eyes, true leaders to their queen,
But for thy piteous lips no more had seen.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: ‚ÄòO! thou didst kill me; kill me once again:
*   **"O! thou didst kill me"**: Venus uses hyperbole to express the profound emotional devastation and anguish caused by Adonis's rejection and coldness. It signifies a metaphorical death of her spirit or emotional well-being. Shakespeare uses "didst kill" to convey the immediate and impactful nature of his effect on her.
*   **"kill me once again"**: This is a paradoxical and masochistic plea. Despite the pain, Venus is so captivated by Adonis's beauty and the intense emotions he evokes that she desires to re-experience that powerful, overwhelming sensation, even if it is painful. It highlights the depth of her obsession.
*   **Meaning:** "Oh! You have already emotionally destroyed me; now, destroy me once more."

---

### Line 2: Thy eyes‚Äô shrewd tutor, that hard heart of thine,
*   **"Thy eyes‚Äô shrewd tutor"**: This is a personification. Venus blames Adonis's "hard heart" for instructing or influencing his eyes. "Shrewd" here means cunning, astute, or even maliciously clever, suggesting that his heart deliberately teaches his eyes to convey coldness. Shakespeare uses this to externalize Adonis's inner resistance.
*   **"that hard heart of thine"**: "Thine" means yours. This phrase directly identifies the source of Adonis's unresponsiveness as his unyielding, unfeeling nature. It starkly contrasts with Venus's own passionate and vulnerable heart, emphasizing the emotional chasm between them.
*   **Meaning:** "It is your cunning instructor, that unfeeling heart of yours,"

---

### Line 3: Hath taught them scornful tricks, and such disdain,
*   **"Hath taught them"**: "Them" refers to Adonis's eyes, continuing the personification from the previous line. His heart is depicted as an active agent in shaping his external expressions.
*   **"scornful tricks"**: This phrase refers to the deliberate ways Adonis's eyes communicate contempt and mockery towards Venus's advances. "Tricks" suggests a practiced or artful way of showing rejection, making his gaze seem intentionally cruel.
*   **"such disdain"**: This means profound contempt or a sense of unworthiness shown through his gaze. This is the direct emotional effect that his "hard heart" has on his eyes, and consequently, on Venus.
*   **Meaning:** "Which has taught your eyes to express contemptuous gestures and such profound rejection,"

---

### Line 4: That they have murder‚Äôd this poor heart of mine;
*   **"That they have murder‚Äôd"**: Another instance of hyperbole and personification. Adonis's eyes, acting under the instruction of his heart, are metaphorically depicted as having "killed" or destroyed Venus's heart. This reinforces the theme of emotional devastation from Line 1 ("kill me").
*   **"this poor heart of mine"**: "Poor" conveys Venus's self-pity and vulnerability, highlighting the stark contrast with Adonis's "hard heart." It emphasizes her defenselessness against his rejection and the depth of her suffering.
*   **Meaning:** "So much so that they have utterly destroyed this vulnerable heart of mine;"

---

### Line 5: And these mine eyes, true leaders to their queen,
*   **"And these mine eyes"**: Refers to Venus's own eyes. She shifts focus from Adonis's eyes to her own.
*   **"true leaders to their queen"**: This is a metaphor. Venus's eyes are portrayed as loyal subjects or guides that are faithfully drawn towards Adonis, following the dictates of her passionate heart, which is personified as their "queen." It implies that her gaze is completely controlled by her intense desire.
*   **Meaning:** "And these eyes of mine, which are loyal guides to my heart (their queen),"

---

### Line 6: But for thy piteous lips no more had seen.
*   **"But for thy piteous lips"**: "But for" means "were it not for." "Piteous" here is somewhat ambiguous. It could mean lips that *should* evoke pity from Adonis, or the potential for his lips to *show* pity (i.e., by responding to her advances). It suggests that Venus holds onto a faint hope that his lips might yet soften or respond.
*   **"no more had seen"**: This implies that if there wasn't even a sliver of hope or potential for reciprocation from Adonis's lips, Venus's own eyes (which are led by her heart) would give up looking at him. It's a plea or a subtle threat that her gaze is sustained only by this fragile possibility.
*   **Meaning:** "Would no longer be able to look (at you), were it not for the (potential for) mercy from your lips."

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza is a powerful expression of Venus's intense, almost self-destructive passion and her profound frustration with Adonis's persistent coldness. She dramatically blames his "hard heart" for deliberately teaching his eyes to convey "scornful tricks" and "disdain," which she perceives as having "murdered" her own "poor heart." This highlights the central conflict of the poem: the clash between Venus's overwhelming desire and Adonis's resolute resistance and emotional unavailability.

The stanza emphasizes the significant role of the *gaze* in their interaction. Adonis's eyes, influenced by his unfeeling heart, inflict pain, while Venus's eyes, loyal to her passionate heart, are drawn to him despite the suffering. The final lines introduce a hint of desperation and conditional hope: Venus implies that her gaze, her pursuit, is sustained only by a faint, almost illusory hope that his "piteous lips" might yet offer some form of reciprocation or mercy.

In the broader context of the poem, this stanza deepens the portrayal of Venus's unrequited love and her escalating emotional torment. It reinforces the theme of the power dynamics between desire and indifference, where Venus, the goddess of love, finds herself helpless against a mortal's refusal. Her dramatic language, bordering on the melodramatic, underscores her overwhelming infatuation and the psychological impact of rejection, setting the stage for her continued, futile attempts to win Adonis over. It also subtly foreshadows the tragic outcome by emphasizing the deep-seated resistance within Adonis that her beauty and passion cannot overcome.
