*Shakespeare's Venus and Adonis*

---

## üìñ Original Stanza
```
This dismal cry rings sadly in her ear,     
Througll which it enters to surprise her heart;
Who, overcome by doubt and bloodless fear,
With cold-pale weakness numbs each feeling part;
Like soldiers, when their captain once doth yield,
They basely fly and dare not stay the field.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: "This dismal cry rings sadly in her ear,"
*   **"dismal cry"**: Refers to the sound Adonis makes after being attacked by the boar, which is foreboding, dreadful, and sorrowful. It signifies a terrible event has occurred. Shakespeare uses "dismal" to immediately establish a tone of tragedy and dread.
*   **"rings sadly"**: Emphasizes the enduring, resonant quality of the sound and its immediate emotional impact on Venus. It doesn't just sound, it *rings* (persists) and evokes sadness.
*   **Meaning:** A dreadful and mournful cry resonates sorrowfully in Venus's ear.

### Line 2: "Througll which it enters to surprise her heart;"
*   **"Througll which it enters"**: "Through which" refers to her ear. The cry (it) passes from her ear into her inner being. The slight typo "Througll" is a common print variation of "Through" from the period.
*   **"to surprise her heart"**: "Surprise" here means to ambush, overcome, or seize suddenly and unexpectedly, not in a pleasant sense. The cry directly assaults her emotional core, catching her off guard and overwhelming her with dread.
*   **Meaning:** This cry penetrates through her ear and suddenly overwhelms her heart, catching her off guard.

---

### Line 3: "Who, overcome by doubt and bloodless fear,"
*   **"Who"**: Refers to Venus.
*   **"overcome by doubt"**: Venus is assailed by uncertainty and apprehension regarding what has happened to Adonis. This "doubt" is a form of dreadful anticipation before the full truth is known.
*   **"bloodless fear"**: A fear so intense that it drains the blood from her face and body, leaving her pale and perhaps cold. It also suggests a fear so potent it metaphorically drains her vitality and ability to act, making her seem lifeless. Shakespeare uses this vivid image to convey extreme terror.
*   **Meaning:** Venus, overwhelmed by agonizing uncertainty and an intense, paralyzing fear that drains her of color,

### Line 4: "With cold-pale weakness numbs each feeling part;"
*   **"cold-pale weakness"**: Her physical and emotional state is characterized by paleness, a sensation of coldness, and a profound lack of strength. This signifies shock and the draining of her vitality.
*   **"numbs each feeling part"**: This weakness causes a physical and emotional paralysis. Her limbs become unresponsive, and her senses or capacity for action are dulled, indicating a complete bodily shutdown due to extreme psychological distress. "Feeling part" refers to her limbs, senses, and indeed her very capacity to react.
*   **Meaning:** ...experiences a cold, pale weakness that renders every part of her body insensible and inert.

---

### Line 5: "Like soldiers, when their captain once doth yield,"
*   **"Like soldiers"**: This initiates a vivid simile, comparing Venus's state to that of soldiers in battle.
*   **"their captain once doth yield"**: "Yield" means to surrender, collapse, or be defeated. The loss of their leader signifies the collapse of their morale and the structure of their defense. This parallels the impact of Adonis's cry on Venus ‚Äì her "captain" (Adonis, or her own will/hope) is seemingly defeated.
*   **Meaning:** Just like soldiers, when their captain is defeated and surrenders,

---

### Line 6: "They basely fly and dare not stay the field."
*   **"basely fly"**: "Basely" means dishonorably, ignobly, or cowardly. "Fly" means to flee or run away. Their flight is depicted as shameful.
*   **"dare not stay the field"**: They lack the courage or will to remain on the battlefield, abandoning their post and duty. This reflects Venus's complete incapacitation and her inability to move or confront the horror implied by the cry.
*   **Meaning:** ...they dishonorably flee the battlefield, lacking the courage to remain.

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

Stanza 149 marks a dramatic and devastating turning point in *Venus and Adonis*. It precisely captures Venus's immediate, visceral, and overwhelming reaction to the sound that signals Adonis's death. Up to this point, Venus has been portrayed as a powerful, ardent, and somewhat dominant figure, relentlessly pursuing Adonis. This stanza abruptly shatters that image, replacing it with one of utter helplessness and physical collapse.

The "dismal cry" acts as the harbinger of tragedy, instantly transforming Venus from a vibrant pursuer into a paralyzed victim of dread. Her "bloodless fear" and "cold-pale weakness" vividly illustrate the profound shock and psychological trauma that drains her vitality, physically manifesting her emotional devastation. The loss of color and sensation signifies the draining of her life force, foreshadowing the death that has just occurred or is about to occur to Adonis.

The powerful simile of the fleeing soldiers underscores Venus's complete incapacitation. It paints a picture of her entire being‚Äîher senses, her will, her physical prowess‚Äîcollapsing in the face of the ultimate defeat, much like soldiers abandon the field when their leader falls. This not only highlights her profound shock but also suggests the perceived "cowardice" of her body to move forward or even process the full horror of what she has heard, revealing the raw, instinctual human response to overwhelming catastrophe.

In the broader context of the poem, this stanza is crucial for several reasons:
1.  **Shift in Narrative Tone:** It definitively shifts the poem's tone from one of passionate, if unrequited, love and playful pursuit to one of impending tragedy, grief, and lament.
2.  **Vulnerability of Love:** It powerfully illustrates the fragility and vulnerability of even the most passionate love in the face of death and fate. Venus's immense power as a goddess of love proves utterly useless against the boar's attack and the inevitability of death.
3.  **Consequences of Desire:** While not directly causing his death, Venus's relentless pursuit led Adonis to the hunt. Her reaction here signifies the devastating consequences of that pursuit and the potential for love to lead to profound suffering.
4.  **Foreshadowing Grief:** This stanza sets the stage for Venus's subsequent lamentations and profound mourning, emphasizing the depth of her initial shock and paving the way for the exploration of grief as a central theme. The "numbing" of her "feeling part" implies a temporary shutdown before the full pain of loss can be experienced.
