```
'It shall be fickle, false, and full of fraud,     
Bud and be blasted in a breathing-while;
The bottom poison, and the top o'erstraw'd
With sweets that shall the truest sight beguile:   
The strongest body shall it make most weak,
Strike the wise dumb and teach the fool to speak.

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza continues Venus's curse by detailing love's deceptive and transformative nature, showing how it will make everything into its opposite and deceive even the most perceptive people.

**The Triple Condemnation**: Love is condemned with three F's‚Äî"fickle, false, and full of fraud"‚Äîcreating a comprehensive indictment of its reliability, honesty, and integrity.

**The Brevity of Bloom**: The image of love budding and being "blasted in a breathing-while" emphasizes love's ephemeral nature‚Äîit appears quickly and is destroyed almost immediately.

**The Poison Foundation**: Love's structure is fundamentally toxic at "the bottom" but disguised with "sweets" on top. This makes love inherently deceptive‚Äîattractive on the surface but harmful at its core.

**The Deception of Appearances**: Even "the truest sight" will be "beguiled" by love's sweet surface, meaning that love's deceptive power exceeds human ability to perceive truth.

**The Reversal of Strength**: Love will transform physical strength into weakness, making the most powerful people completely vulnerable. This shows love's power to invert natural hierarchies.

**The Inversion of Wisdom**: Love creates a world where wise people become speechless while fools become eloquent. This reverses the natural order where wisdom should speak and folly should be silent.

**Love as Universal Transformer**: Venus presents love as a force that transforms everything into its opposite‚Äîstrength becomes weakness, wisdom becomes foolishness, silence becomes speech.

**The Comprehensive Curse**: This stanza shows that Venus's curse covers all aspects of love‚Äîits duration (brief), its nature (deceptive), its effects on the body (weakening), and its effects on the mind (confusing).

**The Democratization of Folly**: By making fools eloquent and wise people silent, love eliminates the distinction between wisdom and foolishness, creating universal confusion.

**Love as Cosmic Disorder**: Venus presents love as a force that will create universal chaos by inverting all natural orders and hierarchies.

This stanza completes the picture of love as a fundamentally deceptive and chaotic force that will transform the world into a place where appearances deceive, strength fails, and wisdom is confounded.
