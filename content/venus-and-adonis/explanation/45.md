```
Imperiously he leaps, he neighs, he bounds,
And now his woven girths he breaks asunder;
The bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds,
Whose hollow womb resounds like heaven‚Äôs thunder;
The iron bit he crusheth ‚Äòtween his teeth,        
Controlling what he was controlled with.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: "Imperiously he leaps, he neighs, he bounds,"
*   **"Imperiously"**: In a commanding, arrogant, or domineering manner; with a sense of superior power. Shakespeare chose this word to immediately establish the horse's majestic, untamed, and defiant nature, setting the tone for its subsequent actions of breaking free.
*   **"leaps"**: Jumps forcefully and high, indicating great energy and an uninhibited, wild spirit.
*   **"neighs"**: The loud, characteristic cry of a horse, often associated with excitement, challenge, or a display of dominance. It adds an auditory dimension to the horse's powerful presence.
*   **"bounds"**: Springs forward or moves with long, powerful strides, suggesting unrestricted and vigorous movement across the ground.
*   **Meaning:** The horse, asserting its dominant will, jumps energetically, whinnies loudly, and moves with powerful, unbridled leaps.

### Line 2: "And now his woven girths he breaks asunder;"
*   **"woven girths"**: Strong straps, typically made of woven material like leather or heavy fabric, that pass under a horse's belly to secure the saddle. "Woven" emphasizes their designed strength and durability.
*   **"breaks asunder"**: Rips or tears apart violently into separate pieces. "Asunder" means into pieces. This phrase highlights the extraordinary physical strength of the horse, capable of destroying restraints meant to control it.
*   **Meaning:** And now, with immense force, he tears apart the strong straps that were holding his saddle in place.

### Line 3: "The bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds,"
*   **"bearing earth"**: The ground that supports, carries, and endures the weight of all things upon it. It evokes a sense of the earth as a foundational and enduring entity.
*   **"hard hoof"**: The tough, keratinous protective covering on a horse's foot. "Hard" emphasizes its density and the forceful impact it can create.
*   **"wounds"**: Causes damage or injury to; marks or mars. This use of "wounds" personifies the earth, suggesting that the horse's powerful impact is so severe it can literally hurt the ground, emphasizing the ferocity of its actions.

*   **"resounds"**: Echoes loudly, reverberates, or produces a deep, prolonged sound.
*   **"like heaven‚Äôs thunder"**: A powerful simile comparing the sound emanating from the earth to the overwhelming, awe-inspiring sound of thunder from the sky. This comparison magnifies the intensity and magnitude of the sound, elevating the horse's actions to a cosmic scale.

### Line 5: "The iron bit he crusheth ‚Äòtween his teeth,"

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza vividly portrays the unbridled power, wildness, and ultimate independence of Adonis's horse as it spectacularly breaks free from all human control. The horse's actions are described with immense energy and destructive force ‚Äì shattering its gear, metaphorically wounding the earth, and even crushing the iron bit that once commanded it. The final line, "Controlling what he was controlled with," serves as a powerful summary of this defiant liberation, where the instrument of subjugation is itself subdued.

In the broader context of Venus and Adonis, this magnificent display by the horse functions as a profound parallel and symbolic foreshadowing of Adonis himself. Just as the horse cannot be tamed or confined by artificial restraints and asserts its primal, natural will, so too does Adonis resist Venus's passionate advances and attempts to "control" his affections. His youthful, untamed spirit prioritizes his chaste pursuits (hunting) over Venus's erotic love. The horse's violent rejection of the bit and girths mirrors Adonis's steadfast refusal of Venus's persuasive efforts and the "yoke" of love she wishes to place upon him.

The stanza emphasizes themes of freedom versus constraint, nature versus culture/civilization, and the overwhelming force of innate desire and will. The horse's raw, almost mythical power‚Äîcapable of making the "earth's womb resound like heaven's thunder"‚Äîunderscores the idea that some natural forces, like the horse's wildness or Adonis's youth and resistance to love, cannot be easily manipulated or contained. This serves to elevate Adonis's own aloofness and independence, making his eventual tragic end (dying while hunting, not yielding to love) more resonant as a consequence of his untamed nature, which, like the horse's, cannot be constrained.
