## üìñ Original Stanza
```
‚ÄòFondling,‚Äô she saith, ‚Äòsince I have hemm‚Äôd thee here
Within the circuit of this ivory pale,
I‚Äôll be a park, and thou shalt be my deer;
Feed where thou wilt, on mountain or in dale:       
Graze on my lips, and if those hills be dry,
Stray lower, where the pleasant fountains lie.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: ‚ÄòFondling,‚Äô she saith, ‚Äòsince I have hemm‚Äôd thee here
*   **"Fondling"**: A term of endearment, implying someone who is treated with great affection and tenderness, often with an underlying hint of possessiveness or control, fitting Venus's approach. Shakespeare uses this to immediately establish Venus's seemingly affectionate but ultimately manipulative tone towards Adonis.
*   **"she saith"**: An archaic form of "she says." Shakespeare employs this older linguistic style to give the poem a classical, timeless feel, fitting its mythological subject matter.
*   **"hemm‚Äôd thee here"**: Means "enclosed or confined you here." It suggests Venus has literally trapped Adonis within her embrace, or at least cornered him, creating a private space for her advances. This choice of word highlights her possessive intent and the physical constraint she has imposed.
*   **Meaning:** "She says, 'My darling, since I have enclosed you here,"

---

### Line 2: Within the circuit of this ivory pale,
*   **"Within the circuit"**: Refers to "within the circumference" or "within the boundary." It reinforces the idea of an enclosed space, emphasizing the 'trap' Venus has set.
*   **"this ivory pale"**: "Pale" here refers to a fence, an enclosure, or a boundary, typically made of stakes (like a palisade). "Ivory" is a metaphor for Venus's arm or body, emphasizing its beauty, smoothness, and paleness, implying she has him encircled within her beautiful, pale embrace. Shakespeare chooses "ivory" to convey preciousness and purity, ironically juxtaposed with her lustful intentions.
*   **Meaning:** "Within the boundary of these beautiful, pale arms (or body),"

---

### Line 3: I‚Äôll be a park, and thou shalt be my deer;
*   **"I‚Äôll be a park"**: Venus offers herself metaphorically as a "park," which in Shakespeare's time could refer to a private hunting ground or a pleasure garden. This sets up an extended metaphor, presenting her body as a domain for Adonis's pleasure. Shakespeare's choice highlights her desire to possess and control Adonis within her own 'grounds'.
*   **"thou shalt be my deer"**: Adonis will be her "deer," the creature she intends to 'hunt' or 'graze' upon within her 'park'. This is a significant reversal of roles, as Adonis is famously a hunter and deer are his prey. Here, Venus positions herself as the dominant pursuer and Adonis as the object of her desire, mirroring the power dynamic in this scene.
*   **Meaning:** "I will be like a private hunting ground, and you shall be my deer;"

---

### Line 4: Feed where thou wilt, on mountain or in dale:
*   **"Feed where thou wilt"**: Continues the 'deer in a park' metaphor, inviting Adonis to graze or consume wherever he pleases within her 'park'. It implies a freedom of exploration, but still within the confines of Venus's body/domain.
*   **"on mountain or in dale"**: This extends the landscape metaphor to Venus's body. "Mountain" refers to higher, more prominent features of her body (like her breasts or hips), while "dale" refers to the valleys or curves of her body. Shakespeare uses this imagery to make the sexual invitation more vivid and less direct, while still being unmistakably clear.
*   **Meaning:** "Graze or eat wherever you wish, whether on my prominent features or in my softer curves:"

---

### Line 5: Graze on my lips, and if those hills be dry,
*   **"Graze on my lips"**: A direct application of the 'feeding' metaphor, meaning to kiss or linger on her lips. It's an invitation for initial, sensual contact.
*   **"if those hills be dry"**: "Hills" here are a metaphor primarily for her lips, suggesting they might not be satisfying enough. It's a double entendre, as "hills" could also subtly hint at her breasts. "Dry" implies not providing sufficient pleasure or moisture, setting up the need to move to a more 'fountain-like' location. Shakespeare uses "dry" to suggest lack of fulfillment, prompting further exploration.
*   **Meaning:** "Kiss my lips, and if they don't satisfy you,"

---

### Line 6: Stray lower, where the pleasant fountains lie.
*   **"Stray lower"**: An explicit instruction to move downwards on her body, indicating a progression towards more intimate areas.
*   **"where the pleasant fountains lie"**: A euphemistic metaphor for her vagina. "Fountains" suggest a source of pleasure, wetness, and life, making the sexual invitation clear and alluring, yet still using figurative language. Shakespeare's choice of "fountains" emphasizes sensuality and the promise of ultimate gratification.
*   **Meaning:** "Move further down to where the delightful, more intimate pleasures are."

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

Stanza 39 is a pivotal moment in Venus's relentless pursuit of Adonis, encapsulating her ardent desire and aggressive sexual proposition. Having cornered him, she now openly offers her body as a landscape for his pleasure.

The core of the stanza lies in the extended metaphor of Venus as a "park" and Adonis as her "deer." This ingenious device serves several crucial purposes:
1.  **Role Reversal:** It fundamentally reverses the traditional roles. Adonis, the skilled hunter, becomes the hunted, or rather, the desired prey within Venus's enclosure. This highlights Venus's dominant and unconventional agency in the courtship, actively subverting typical gender dynamics where the male is the pursuer.
2.  **Possession and Control:** By offering herself as a "park," Venus asserts her control over the situation and Adonis. He is invited to "feed where thou wilt," but implicitly, he is still within *her* domain, suggesting a form of delightful captivity. Her phrase "hemm'd thee here" reinforces this sense of entrapment, however luxurious it may be.
3.  **Explicit Sexual Invitation:** Beneath the poetic veil of natural imagery, the stanza is an explicit and escalating sexual invitation. Starting with a gentle request to "graze on my lips," it quickly progresses to a more profound exploration of her body, symbolized by "mountains," "dales," and ultimately, "pleasant fountains." This directness reveals the depth of Venus's lust, contrasting sharply with Adonis's youthful innocence and aversion to such physical advances.

In the broader context of *Venus and Adonis*, this stanza underscores several key themes:
*   **The Power of Lust vs. Chastity:** It vividly portrays Venus's overwhelming, almost consuming, lust, which clashes directly with Adonis's desire for purity, hunting, and a more innocent, non-sexual relationship with nature. This contrast is central to the poem's conflict.
*   **Nature of Desire:** The stanza explores the physical, aggressive, and often unrequited nature of desire. Venus's language is sensual and persuasive, yet her efforts are largely futile against Adonis's steadfast rejection, highlighting the futility of forced love.
*   **Gender Dynamics:** The poem consistently challenges traditional gender roles, with Venus as the active, predatory female and Adonis as the passive, elusive male. Stanza 39 is a prime example of this inversion, setting the stage for the ongoing push and pull between them.

Ultimately, Stanza 39 encapsulates Venus's desperate and passionate attempt to win Adonis through sheer physical offering and sensual persuasion, setting a clear boundary between her carnal desire and his chaste resistance that drives the narrative of the poem.
