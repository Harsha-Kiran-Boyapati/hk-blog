'It shall suspect where is no cause of fear;
It shall not fear where it should most mistrust;

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza continues Venus's curse by detailing love's capacity for misjudgment and perversity, showing how it will make people act contrary to wisdom and their own natures.

**The Failure of Judgment**: Love will make people "suspect where is no cause of fear" while failing to "fear where it should most mistrust." This shows love destroying practical wisdom and sound judgment.

**The Paradox of Justice**: Love will be "most deceiving when it seems most just," suggesting that love's apparent righteousness is actually its most dangerous deception. When love appears most moral, it's actually most corrupt.

**Simultaneous Contradictions**: Love will be both "merciful, and too severe," showing that it won't alternate between extremes but will somehow embody contradictory qualities simultaneously.

**The Perversity Principle**: "Perverse it shall be, where it shows most toward" indicates that love will be most contrary precisely when it appears most cooperative, making it impossible to predict or trust.

**Courage and Cowardice Reversal**: Love will "put fear to velour, courage to the coward," completely inverting natural bravery. Those who should be bold will become timid, while the naturally timid will become recklessly brave.

**The Impossibility of Wisdom in Love**: Venus's curse makes it impossible to navigate love wisely because love will invert all normal rules of prudence and judgment.

**Universal Misjudgment**: This stanza suggests that love will make accurate assessment impossible‚Äîpeople will fear the wrong things and trust what they should fear.

**The End of Reliable Character**: By making the brave fearful and cowards brave, love eliminates the reliability of character traits, making human nature unpredictable.

**Love as Cosmic Confusion**: Venus presents love as a force that will make universal confusion by ensuring that people's responses are always inappropriate to their situations.

**The Curse of Inappropriate Response**: Love will ensure that emotional and behavioral responses are always mismatched to circumstances, creating universal social and personal chaos.

This stanza shows Venus cursing humanity with a love that makes sound judgment impossible, ensuring that lovers will always respond inappropriately to their circumstances and be most deceived when they feel most certain.
