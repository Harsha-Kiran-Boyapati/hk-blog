## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: ‚ÄòNo, no,‚Äô quoth she, ‚Äòsweet Death, I did but jest;
*   **"No, no,"**: A rapid, emphatic denial, indicating a retraction or reversal of her previous, extreme statements, particularly her hyperbolic threat to conquer Death.
*   **"quoth she"**: An archaic phrase meaning "said she." It identifies Venus as the speaker.
*   **"sweet Death"**: An apostrophe, where Venus directly addresses Death as if it were a sentient being. The term "sweet" is ironic or a placating gesture, as she has just been raging against Death; it's an attempt to soften her earlier hostility.
*   **"I did but jest"**: "I was only joking" or "I merely spoke in jest/lightly." This is Venus's confession that her previous, dramatic declarations were not meant literally, but were born of an extreme emotional state.
*   **Meaning:** "No, no," she said, "Oh, Death, my dear, I was only joking with my threats earlier."

---

### Line 2: Yet pardon me, I felt a kind of fear
*   **"Yet pardon me"**: "However, forgive me" or "Please excuse me." This is a humble request for forgiveness, showing a shift from her earlier defiant tone.
*   **"a kind of fear"**: Implies a profound, specific, and overwhelming type of fear, not just a casual apprehension, emphasizing its intensity and the cause of her outburst.
*   **Meaning:** "Yet forgive me, for I truly felt a deep fear."

---

### Line 3: Whenas I met the boar, that bloody beast,
*   **"Whenas"**: An archaic conjunction meaning "when" or "at the time when."
*   **"I met the boar"**: Refers to Venus's actual encounter (or vivid apprehension) of the wild boar that Adonis is intent on hunting.
*   **"that bloody beast"**: "Bloody" here suggests both its capacity for shedding blood (violence) and its cruel, savage nature. "Beast" emphasizes its brutish, dangerous, and untamed quality. Shakespeare uses "bloody" to heighten the sense of danger and revulsion.
*   **Meaning:** "When I encountered the boar, that vicious, bloodthirsty animal,"

---

### Line 4: Which knows no pity, but is still severe;
*   **"Which knows no pity"**: Personifies the boar, attributing to it a human-like lack of compassion or mercy, highlighting its ruthless nature. This makes the boar seem like an agent of an indifferent fate.
*   **"but is still severe"**: "But is always harsh/cruel." "Still" here means "always" or "constantly." It emphasizes the boar's unyielding and destructive nature.
*   **Meaning:** "Which possesses no mercy, but is perpetually harsh and cruel;"

---

### Line 5: Then, gentle shadow,--truth I must confess--
*   **"Then, gentle shadow"**: Venus again addresses Death (whom she called "sweet Death" earlier). "Shadow" refers to Death's intangible, non-physical, and often unseen presence. "Gentle" is another appeasing adjective, a rhetorical strategy to placate the entity she fears.
*   **"truth I must confess"**: A parenthetical admission, indicating sincerity and a moment of vulnerability. It underscores that she is now speaking honestly about the underlying cause of her previous dramatic display.
*   **Meaning:** "At that point, gentle Death‚ÄîI must confess the truth‚Äî"

---

### Line 6: I rail‚Äôd on thee, fearing my love‚Äôs decease.
*   **"I rail‚Äôd on thee"**: "I angrily scolded/reproached you (Death)." "Rail" means to utter bitter complaints or vehement denunciations, showing the intensity of her anger and fear-driven outburst.
*   **"fearing my love‚Äôs decease"**: "Because I was afraid of my beloved (Adonis)'s death." "Decease" is a more formal term for death, maintaining a certain poetic dignity even in her confession of fear. This reveals the core motivation behind her actions.
*   **Meaning:** "I angrily denounced you, because I was terrified of my beloved's death."

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza marks a crucial moment of transition for Venus, moving from dramatic, almost theatrical, declarations of power over Death to a more vulnerable and honest confession of her underlying fear. Her earlier pronouncements (in previous stanzas) that she could conquer Death through her grief are now recanted as mere "jest," an admission prompted by the overwhelming terror she experienced upon encountering the boar.

The significance in the context of the poem is multifaceted:

1.  **Revealing True Motivation:** This stanza clarifies that Venus's over-the-top pronouncements and actions stem not from a genuine belief in her power to defy fate, but from a profound and primal fear for Adonis's life. "Fearing my love‚Äôs decease" is the ultimate driving force behind her desperation to dissuade Adonis from hunting.
2.  **Humanizing Venus:** Despite her divine status, Venus here exhibits very human qualities: fear, regret for exaggerated speech, and a desperate attempt to negotiate with the forces of death. This makes her more relatable and underscores the universal vulnerability to mortality, even for gods when their beloved mortals are threatened.
3.  **Foreshadowing Tragedy:** Her intense fear of the "bloody beast" and Adonis's "decease" heavily foreshadows the tragic climax of the poem. The boar is personified as an unpitying, severe entity, almost a literal embodiment of Death, which Venus recognizes as an insurmountable threat.
4.  **Love vs. Death:** The stanza directly confronts the central theme of the poem: the power of passionate love in the face of inevitable death. Venus's love for Adonis is so immense that it makes her challenge Death itself, yet her subsequent retraction reveals the ultimate futility of such a challenge. Her attempt to "rail on" Death is an act of defiance, but her later attempt to pacify "gentle shadow" shows her recognition of its power and her desperate hope to avert its grasp.
5.  **Shifting Dynamics:** This recantation signals a shift in Venus's persuasive strategy. Having failed to physically restrain Adonis and having exhausted dramatic posturing, she now attempts a more earnest, confessional plea, hoping to appeal to his understanding by revealing the depth of her terror.

Ultimately, this stanza underscores that even divine love cannot conquer the fear of loss or the inevitability of death, setting a somber tone for the impending tragedy.
