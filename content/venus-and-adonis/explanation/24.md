```
‚ÄòThou canst not see one winkle in my brow;  
Mine eyes are grey and bright, and quick in turning;
My beauty as the spring doth yearly grow;
My flesh is soft and plump, my marrow burning;
My smooth moist hand, were it with thy hand felt.
Would in thy palm dissolve, or seem to melt.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: ‚ÄòThou canst not see one winkle in my brow;
*   **"Thou canst not"**: An archaic form meaning "You cannot." Venus is directly addressing Adonis.
*   **"winkle"**: An archaic spelling of "wrinkle." Shakespeare chose this word to indicate Venus's flawless youth and the complete absence of any sign of age on her forehead.
*   **"in my brow"**: On my forehead or face.
*   **Meaning:** "You cannot find a single wrinkle on my forehead."
---
### Line 2: Mine eyes are grey and bright, and quick in turning;
*   **"grey"**: In Shakespeare's time, "grey" eyes were often considered beautiful and intelligent, sometimes referring to a sparkling light blue or a clear, bright color rather than dull grey. It implies a captivating and vibrant hue.
*   **"bright"**: Luminous, sparkling, full of life and vitality.
*   **"quick in turning"**: Suggests lively, darting, expressive eyes, indicating alertness, intelligence, and perhaps flirtatiousness or passion. Shakespeare uses this to convey Venus's spirited and alluring gaze.
*   **Meaning:** "My eyes are a beautiful, sparkling color and move quickly and expressively."
---
### Line 3: My beauty as the spring doth yearly grow;
*   **"as the spring doth yearly grow"**: A simile comparing her beauty to the annual renewal and growth seen in springtime. Spring is a season of new life, blossoms, and increasing vibrancy.
*   **Meaning:** "My beauty, like the spring, continuously renews and increases year after year."
---
### Line 4: My flesh is soft and plump, my marrow burning;
*   **"soft and plump"**: Describes youthful, smooth, and well-nourished skin and body, conveying a sense of tactile desirability and health.
*   **"my marrow burning"**: "Marrow" was considered the core essence of the body, vitality, or deepest being. "Burning" signifies intense internal heat, fervent passion, and strong sexual desire. Shakespeare uses this vivid image to express the depth of her ardour.
*   **Meaning:** "My body is soft and full, and I feel an intense passion burning deep within me."
---
### Line 5: My smooth moist hand, were it with thy hand felt,
*   **"smooth moist hand"**: "Smooth" indicates youth and lack of calluses; "moist" suggests warmth, vitality, and perhaps the slight perspiration of arousal, making it sensually inviting.
*   **"were it with thy hand felt"**: An archaic conditional clause meaning "if it were touched by your hand."
*   **Meaning:** "If my smooth, warm hand were to be touched by your hand,"
---
### Line 6: Would in thy palm dissolve, or seem to melt.
*   **"dissolve, or seem to melt"**: This is hyperbole, an exaggeration for effect. It conveys an overwhelming sensation of intense pleasure, passion, or yielding surrender upon physical contact. It implies that the intensity of their potential union would be so great that her hand would feel as if it were physically softening and giving way in his touch, symbolizing complete capitulation to desire.
*   **Meaning:** "...it would feel so intensely pleasurable that it would seem to melt or dissolve in your palm."

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza is a pivotal part of Venus's sustained and highly detailed attempt to seduce Adonis. Through a series of self-descriptions, Venus presents herself as the epitome of youthful, unblemished beauty and overwhelming vitality. She meticulously highlights every desirable physical attribute, from her wrinkle-free brow and bright, expressive eyes, to her "soft and plump" flesh and "smooth moist hand." The key emphasis is not just on her current beauty but on its perennial nature, metaphorically likened to the constantly renewing spring, suggesting she is immune to the ravages of time.

The most significant lines, "my marrow burning" and "Would in thy palm dissolve, or seem to melt," underscore the intensity of her internal desire and the profound, almost overwhelming, physical effect she expects their union to have. These lines move beyond mere physical description to convey a deep, burning passion and an eager readiness for sexual surrender.

In the broader context of *Venus and Adonis*, this stanza reinforces Venus's role as the aggressive, persistent embodiment of natural, fertile, and often overwhelming love and lust. Her verbose and highly sensory descriptions contrast sharply with Adonis's youthful reticence and his preference for the chaste pursuit of the hunt. This stanza encapsulates the poem's central conflict: the powerful, all-consuming nature of desire (Venus) attempting to capture and transform a more aloof, unready, and perhaps even asexual youth (Adonis). It showcases Venus's confidence in her own allure and her strategic attempt to overwhelm Adonis with promises of sensual delight, setting the stage for the poem's exploration of desire, beauty, and the often unrequited or mismatched nature of passion.
