## üìñ Original Stanza
```
'It shall be sparing and too full of riot,
Teaching decrepit age to tread the measures;       
The staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet,
Pluck down the rich, enrich the poor with treasures;
It shall be raging mad, and silly mild,
Make the young old, the old become a child.

This stanza continues Venus's curse by showing how love will create universal chaos through contradictions and inversions of natural order, making everything into its opposite simultaneously.

**The Ultimate Contradiction**: Love will be both "sparing and too full of riot"‚Äîsimultaneously restrained and wild, creating impossible contradictions within single relationships.

**Social Revolution**: Love will "pluck down the rich" and "enrich the poor," making it a force for complete social upheaval that destroys existing class structures.

**Age Inversion**: Love will make "the young old" and "the old become a child," reversing the natural progression of life and making age meaningless.

**Behavioral Transformation**: Even dangerous "ruffians" will be made "quiet" by love, showing its power to transform fundamental personality traits.

**The Dancing Dead**: The image of "decrepit age" learning to "tread the measures" shows love making the impossible happen‚Äîthe elderly becoming dancers despite physical limitations.

**Emotional Schizophrenia**: Love will be "raging mad, and silly mild" simultaneously, creating internal emotional contradictions that make stable feeling impossible.

**Economic Chaos**: By reversing wealth distribution, love becomes a force for complete economic disruption, destroying material security.

**The End of Categories**: Venus's curse eliminates all stable categories‚Äîrich/poor, young/old, violent/peaceful, mad/mild‚Äîmaking social organization impossible.

**Universal Instability**: Every aspect of human society and individual psychology will be subject to love's contradictory transformations.

**The Impossibility of Prediction**: With love creating simultaneous opposites, no one can predict how it will affect them or their society.

This stanza shows Venus cursing humanity with a love that makes all stable categories meaningless, creating a world of perpetual contradiction and social chaos.
