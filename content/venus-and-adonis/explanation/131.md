## üìñ Original Stanza
```
‚ÄòLest the deceiving harmony should run
Into the quiet closure of my breast;
And then my little heart were quite undone,
In his bedchamber to be barr‚Äôd of rest.     
No, lady, no; my heart longs not to groan,
But soundly sleeps, while now it sleeps alone.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: ‚ÄòLest the deceiving harmony should run
*   **"Lest"**: An archaic conjunction meaning "for fear that" or "so that... not." It introduces a preventative measure or a negative purpose.
*   **"deceiving harmony"**: Refers to Venus's alluring, persuasive words and the captivating nature of her seductive arguments, which Adonis perceives as treacherous and aimed at misleading him from his path of chastity and hunting. "Harmony" suggests a pleasing sound or agreement, but "deceiving" exposes its perceived danger. Shakespeare chose "deceiving" to highlight Adonis's mistrust and his understanding that Venus's appeals, though beautiful, are intended to trick him into a state he wishes to avoid.
*   **"should run"**: Implies a swift, pervasive, and potentially intrusive movement, as if Venus's words could flow directly into and occupy his inner being. It suggests the power and fluidity of her persuasive speech.
*   **Meaning:** "For fear that your deceptive, alluring words might penetrate..."

### Line 2: Into the quiet closure of my breast;
*   **"quiet closure"**: This is a metaphor for Adonis's heart or inner being, which he wishes to keep sealed off, undisturbed, and protected from external influences, particularly Venus's advances. "Quiet" emphasizes his desire for peace and unmolested innocence, while "closure" suggests a secure, locked, or secluded space.
*   **"of my breast"**: A common metonymy where "breast" refers to the chest as the seat of emotions, the heart, and thus the inner self. It physically locates the 'closure' that Adonis is keen to protect.
*   **Meaning:** "...into the peaceful, secluded sanctuary of my heart."

---

### Line 3: And then my little heart were quite undone,
*   **"And then"**: Indicates the direct consequence or feared outcome if the "deceiving harmony" were to enter his inner sanctuary.
*   **"my little heart"**: Emphasizes Adonis's youth, innocence, and vulnerability. "Little" suggests it is not yet mature, hardened, or experienced in the ways of passionate love, making it susceptible to being overwhelmed.
*   **"were quite undone"**: Would be completely ruined, destroyed, or incapacitated. "Undone" implies a loss of integrity, composure, or the state of being chaste and emotionally untouched. It suggests a profound and irreversible negative transformation.
*   **Meaning:** "And if they did, then my young, vulnerable heart would be completely ruined."

---

### Line 4: In his bedchamber to be barr‚Äôd of rest.
*   **"In his bedchamber"**: Continues the personification of the heart, imagining it as a person residing in its private room. This "bedchamber" is the innermost, most private space of the heart, where it naturally seeks peace and repose. It reinforces the metaphor of the heart's "closure."
*   **"to be barr‚Äôd of rest"**: To be forcibly deprived of its peace, quiet, or sleep. "Barr'd" suggests a forceful exclusion or denial, indicating that Venus's influence would violently disrupt the heart's natural state of tranquility. It implies a state of agitation or sleeplessness caused by unwanted desires or emotions.
*   **Meaning:** "Being in its private place of rest, it would be forcibly deprived of its peace."

---

### Line 5: No, lady, no; my heart longs not to groan,
*   **"No, lady, no"**: A strong, emphatic, and repeated denial. The repetition underscores Adonis's firm and absolute rejection of Venus's advances and her underlying assumption that his heart desires love or passion.
*   **"my heart longs not to groan"**: "Groan" is associated with suffering, pain, or the pangs of unfulfilled desire, particularly amorous or sexual longing. Adonis denies that his heart yearns for such emotional or physical turmoil, directly refuting Venus's attempts to portray him as a pining lover.
*   **Meaning:** "No, lady, absolutely not; my heart does not yearn to suffer or sigh with passion."

---

### Line 6: But soundly sleeps, while now it sleeps alone.
*   **"But soundly sleeps"**: Directly contrasts with the idea of groaning or being "barr'd of rest." "Soundly" emphasizes that his heart is deeply, peacefully, and undisturbed. This highlights Adonis's preference for tranquility over the emotional upheaval of love.
*   **"while now it sleeps alone"**: This is the crucial condition for its "sound" sleep. "Alone" here signifies undisturbed virginity, emotional autonomy, and freedom from the complications and demands of love or lust. It implies that being *not* alone (i.e., engaging in love with Venus) would awaken and disturb this cherished peace. Shakespeare uses "alone" to signify a state of pure, untroubled innocence.
*   **Meaning:** "Instead, it sleeps deeply and peacefully, precisely because it is currently free from the disturbances of love."

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

Stanza 131 is a powerful articulation of Adonis's determined resistance to Venus's aggressive seduction. It reveals his profound desire for autonomy, peace, and the preservation of his youthful innocence. He frames his refusal not merely as disinterest, but as a necessary defense against what he perceives as the dangerous, "deceiving harmony" of Venus's persuasive words and her overwhelming carnal presence. The intricate metaphors of his heart as a "quiet closure" and having a "bedchamber" vividly portray his inner self as a sanctuary that he desperately wants to keep inviolate from the disruptive and passionate forces Venus represents.

Adonis's assertion that his heart "soundly sleeps, while now it sleeps alone" is key. It directly counters Venus's worldview, which champions love and union as the ultimate good. For Adonis, peace and contentment are found in his current state of emotional and physical solitude, free from the turmoil he associates with Venus's brand of passionate love. This stanza underscores a central conflict in the poem: the clash between youthful purity and mature, assertive desire, and between self-preservation/innocence and the surrender demanded by love and procreation. Adonis's declaration solidifies his character as a young man deeply committed to his chosen path of hunting and chastity, unwilling to succumb to the overwhelming, often predatory, force of love. This moment highlights his agency and provides a moral counterpoint to Venus's unrestrained passion, making the poem a complex exploration of desire, consent, and the vulnerability of innocence.
