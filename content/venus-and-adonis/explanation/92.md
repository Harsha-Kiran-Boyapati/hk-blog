## üìñ Original Stanza
```
Now quick desire hath caught the yielding prey,
And glutton-like she feeds, yet never filleth;      
Her lips are conquerors, his lips obey,
Paying what ransom the insulter willeth;
Whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high,
That she will draw his lips‚Äô rich treasure dry.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: "Now quick desire hath caught the yielding prey,"
*   **"Now quick desire"**: Refers to Venus's immediate and intense lust or passion. "Quick" emphasizes its sudden, urgent, and impulsive nature. "Desire" is personified, acting as an active hunter. Shakespeare chose "quick" to convey the urgency and impetuosity of Venus's overpowering lust.
*   **"hath caught"**: An archaic form of "has caught," indicating an action that has just been completed or is currently in the process of completion. It emphasizes the immediacy of the capture.
*   **"the yielding prey"**: Refers to Adonis, who, despite his reluctance, is now physically within Venus's grasp. "Yielding" suggests he is succumbing or giving way, even if unwillingly, to her physical advances. "Prey" highlights the predator-victim dynamic, casting Venus as the hunter and Adonis as the vulnerable target. Shakespeare uses "prey" to underscore Adonis's helplessness and Venus's aggressive, consuming nature.
*   **Meaning:** "At this moment, swift and intense passion has seized the submissive Adonis."

### Line 2: "And glutton-like she feeds, yet never filleth;"
*   **"And glutton-like she feeds"**: Compares Venus's consumption of Adonis's kisses or physical presence to the insatiable eating of a glutton. "Feeds" implies a voracious, unrestrained, and almost desperate act of consumption. Shakespeare uses "glutton-like" to emphasize the excessiveness, self-indulgence, and lack of restraint in Venus's desire.
*   **"yet never filleth"**: Despite her ravenous "feeding," Venus's desire is never satisfied; it remains unquenched. "Filleth" is an archaic form of "fills." This highlights the boundless and unending nature of her lust, which cannot be satiated no matter how much she takes. Shakespeare chose "never filleth" to convey the bottomless and unquenchable nature of her desire, a key aspect of destructive, unreciprocated lust.
*   **Meaning:** "And she consumes him with an insatiable appetite, yet her hunger is never satisfied."

---

### Line 3: "Her lips are conquerors, his lips obey,"
*   **"Her lips are conquerors"**: Personifies Venus's lips as victorious generals or invaders, asserting absolute dominance and control in the kiss. This reinforces the power imbalance and her aggressive, forceful pursuit. Shakespeare attributes the quality of "conquerors" to her lips to vividly illustrate her active, dominant, and overpowering role in the physical encounter.
*   **"his lips obey"**: Contrasts sharply with Venus's lips, depicting Adonis's lips as passive and subservient, forced into compliance or submission. This further emphasizes his lack of agency, resistance, and the overwhelming nature of Venus's advances. Shakespeare uses "obey" to show Adonis's submissiveness and the one-sided power dynamic, where he is the unwilling participant.
*   **Meaning:** "Her lips are victorious and dominant in the embrace, while his lips passively submit to her will."

---

### Line 4: "Paying what ransom the insulter willeth;"
*   **"Paying what ransom"**: Continues the military or capture metaphor from "conquerors." Adonis's kisses or physical submission are the "ransom" he is forced to pay to Venus. "Ransom" implies a price extracted for release, but here it signifies the cost of his "capture" or simply the forced continuation of the encounter. Shakespeare uses "ransom" to reinforce the idea of a forced payment or submission in a context of capture or domination.
*   **"the insulter willeth"**: "The insulter" refers to Venus, casting her as someone who abuses, demands, or compels disrespectfully. "Willeth" is an archaic form of "wills" or "desires/demands." This phrase underscores her authoritative, demanding, and almost abusive nature, presenting her actions as an imposition. Shakespeare chooses "insulter" to highlight the aggressive, forceful, and potentially demeaning nature of Venus's demands.
*   **Meaning:** "His lips are forced to give whatever payment or satisfaction the demanding and aggressive Venus desires."

---

### Line 5: "Whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high,"
*   **"Whose vulture thought"**: "Whose" refers to Venus. "Vulture thought" is a powerful metaphor. A vulture is a bird of prey associated with greed, scavenging, and preying on the vulnerable or dead. Applying this to her "thought" or desire implies her desire is rapacious, predatory, and perhaps even morbid or draining. Shakespeare uses "vulture thought" to vividly portray Venus's destructive, insatiable, and predatory desire, likening it to a scavenger that relentlessly devours.
*   **"doth pitch the price so high"**: Continues the "ransom" metaphor from the previous line. Her "vulture thought" (her boundless, predatory lust) demands an impossibly high "price" or level of satisfaction. "Pitch the price" means to set the price. The "price" here is the endless physical engagement and kisses she demands. Shakespeare uses "pitch the price so high" to indicate the exorbitant and unquenchable nature of her desire, which can never be fully satisfied.
*   **Meaning:** "Her rapacious, predatory desire sets such an exorbitant demand for satisfaction,"

---

### Line 6: "That she will draw his lips‚Äô rich treasure dry."
*   **"That she will draw"**: Implies a sustained, exhaustive action. "Draw" suggests extracting, draining, or pulling something out completely.
*   **"his lips‚Äô rich treasure"**: "His lips" refers to Adonis's kisses, his very essence, or the sweetness and vitality he possesses. "Rich treasure" metaphorically describes the value and preciousness of what he offers, which Venus is consuming. It highlights the invaluable nature of what she is taking. Shakespeare uses "rich treasure" to emphasize the preciousness and vitality that Adonis possesses, which Venus is relentlessly consuming.
*   **"dry"**: The ultimate consequence of her rapacious desire. She will completely deplete him, leaving nothing. This signifies the destructive, exhaustive nature of her lust, which will drain Adonis of his vitality or the sweetness of his kisses until nothing is left. Shakespeare uses "dry" to convey the complete exhaustion and depletion of Adonis, underscoring the destructive potential of Venus's insatiable lust.
*   **Meaning:** "So much so that she will completely drain all the vitality and preciousness from his lips, leaving nothing left."

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza offers a stark and powerful portrayal of Venus's insatiable lust and her aggressive, predatory pursuit of Adonis. It establishes a clear and unsettling power imbalance: Venus is depicted as the active, dominant "conqueror" and "insulter" whose "quick desire" "hath caught the yielding prey," while Adonis is reduced to a passive, submissive figure whose "lips obey" and are forced into "paying what ransom" she "willeth."

The stanza's central theme is the destructive and consuming nature of uncontrolled passion. The vivid imagery of "glutton-like she feeds, yet never filleth" and "Whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high, / That she will draw his lips‚Äô rich treasure dry" underscores the boundless, self-serving, and ultimately exhausting quality of Venus's desire. Her lust is not a force of mutual affection or connection, but one of relentless consumption, akin to a predator draining its prey.

In the broader context of *Venus and Adonis*, this stanza is crucial for developing several key themes:
1.  **The Perils of Unbridled Lust:** It serves as a strong warning against passion that is purely physical, unreciprocated, and devoid of genuine love or respect. Venus's actions illustrate how such desire can become rapacious and destructive.
2.  **Gendered Power Dynamics:** The poem consistently reverses traditional gender roles, with Venus as the aggressive pursuer and Adonis as the reluctant, objectified victim. This stanza particularly highlights Venus's dominance and Adonis's subjugation through language of conquest and forced payment.
3.  **Innocence vs. Experience/Corruption:** Adonis's "rich treasure" (his purity, vitality, and perhaps even his youthful resistance) is being threatened and depleted by Venus's "vulture thought" and insatiable "feeding." This foreshadows the ultimate draining of his vitality, aligning with the poem's theme of the loss of innocence.
4.  **Love as Consumption, Not Connection:** The stanza emphasizes that Venus's "love" is about taking and possessing, not sharing or connecting. Her actions are portrayed as a one-sided extraction, highlighting the tragic and unfulfilling nature of such a relationship.

Ultimately, this stanza solidifies Venus's character as a force of nature driven by unquenchable desire, and it intensifies the tragic trajectory of Adonis, who is caught in her consuming embrace, foreshadowing his eventual exhaustion and tragic end.
