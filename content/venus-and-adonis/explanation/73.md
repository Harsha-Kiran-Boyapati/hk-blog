## üìñ Original Stanza
```
‚ÄòHad I no eyes but ears, my ears would love
That inward beauty and invisible;
Or were I deaf, thy outward parts would move
Each part in me that were but sensible:     
Though neither eyes nor ears, to hear nor see,
Yet should I be in love by touching thee.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: ‚ÄòHad I no eyes but ears, my ears would love
*   **"Had I no eyes but ears"**: This phrase establishes a hypothetical condition where Venus lacks the sense of sight and relies solely on hearing. It sets the stage for a thought experiment exploring the nature of attraction beyond conventional visual cues.
*   **"my ears would love"**: This is an instance of personification, attributing the capacity for "love" or profound appreciation to the sense of hearing. It suggests that even through sound, her ears would discern something lovable about Adonis.
*   **Meaning:** "If I had no eyes and only ears, my sense of hearing would still find a way to love you."

---

### Line 2: That inward beauty and invisible;
*   **"That inward beauty"**: Refers to the non-physical aspects of Adonis's appeal, such as his character, spirit, or qualities perceptible through non-visual means (e.g., through his voice, words, or the impression he makes). It contrasts with outward, visible appearance.
*   **"and invisible"**: This word emphasizes that the beauty being referred to is not something that can be seen with the eyes. It underscores the idea that love or attraction can stem from qualities that are not physically manifest. Shakespeare chose this to suggest a deeper, non-superficial aspect of Adonis, or at least Venus's desperate attempt to find one.
*   **Meaning:** "That inner, unseen beauty that is not visible to the eye."

---

### Line 3: Or were I deaf, thy outward parts would move
*   **"Or were I deaf"**: This introduces a second hypothetical scenario, where Venus lacks the sense of hearing. It shifts the focus to other senses, particularly sight or touch, as means of perception.
*   **"thy outward parts"**: This refers specifically to Adonis's physical body, his external appearance and form. It creates a direct contrast with the "inward beauty" mentioned in the previous line, highlighting a different kind of allure.
*   **"would move"**: This means "would stir," "would affect deeply," or "would excite." It conveys a powerful, visceral reaction.
*   **Meaning:** "Or if I were deaf, your physical appearance would deeply affect."

---

### Line 4: Each part in me that were but sensible:
*   **"Each part in me"**: This phrase suggests every faculty, organ, or sensory component of Venus's being. It implies a total, comprehensive response.
*   **"that were but sensible"**: Here, "sensible" means capable of feeling, perceiving, or responding to sensation. It refers to any part of her being that possesses the capacity for physical or emotional sensation. Shakespeare uses "sensible" in its older meaning to convey a profound, fundamental bodily reaction.
*   **Meaning:** "Every part of me that is capable of feeling or perceiving."

---

### Line 5: Though neither eyes nor ears, to hear nor see,
*   **"Though neither eyes nor ears"**: This is a powerful cumulative hypothetical condition, imagining Venus as being both blind and deaf. It pushes the boundaries of sensory deprivation to emphasize the overwhelming nature of her attraction.
*   **"to hear nor see"**: This clarifies and reinforces the specific functions of the senses being negated, leaving no doubt about the extreme conditions being proposed.
*   **Meaning:** "Even if I had neither eyes nor ears, unable to hear or see,"

---

### Line 6: Yet should I be in love by touching thee.
*   **"Yet should I be in love"**: Despite the complete absence of sight and hearing, Venus asserts that her love for Adonis would still be an undeniable reality. "Should" here implies a strong certainty or inevitability.
*   **"by touching thee"**: This highlights the sense of touch as the ultimate and most fundamental means through which her attraction would manifest. It represents the most intimate and primal form of sensory experience, suggesting that Adonis's allure is so potent it bypasses the primary senses and resides in raw physical contact. Shakespeare culminates Venus's argument with touch to emphasize her intense physical desire for Adonis.
*   **Meaning:** "I would still fall in love with you simply by touching you."

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza is a powerful declaration of Venus's all-consuming desire for Adonis. It's a rhetorical masterpiece, part of her lengthy attempt to persuade the young, reluctant Adonis to reciprocate her advances. Venus argues that her attraction to him is not superficial or dependent on specific senses like sight or hearing, but is so profound and intrinsic that it would exist even in the most extreme conditions of sensory deprivation.

The stanza's progression, moving from "ears" to "outward parts" (seen by eyes) and finally to the most intimate sense of "touch," reflects Venus's increasing desperation and the raw physicality of her lust. She is essentially telling Adonis that his appeal is so overwhelming that it transcends conventional perception; it's a fundamental, unavoidable force that would affect her on the deepest, most primal level, even through mere contact.

In the broader context of *Venus and Adonis*, this stanza highlights several key themes:
*   **The Power of Desire:** It showcases the intense, almost obsessive nature of Venus's carnal desire, which she presents as an inescapable truth.
*   **Persuasion and Rhetoric:** Venus employs sophisticated rhetorical strategies to convince Adonis, using hypothetical arguments to elevate her physical longing into a seemingly intellectual or fated connection.
*   **Love vs. Lust:** While Venus frames her feeling as "love," the emphasis on "outward parts" and particularly "touching thee" underscores the poem's central tension between a purely physical, carnal lust (Venus) and a more chaste or natural innocence (Adonis). Her argument here is ultimately a justification of her physical craving.
*   **The Objectification of Adonis:** Despite her flowery language, Venus's focus remains on Adonis's physical being, reducing him to an object of her desire, regardless of his will.

Ultimately, this stanza solidifies Venus's character as a goddess driven by overwhelming passion and underscores the tragic irony that despite such fervent and eloquent declarations of desire, Adonis remains utterly unswayed.
