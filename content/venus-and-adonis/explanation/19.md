```
‚ÄòThus he that overrul‚Äôd I oversway‚Äôd,
Leading him prisoner in a red-rose chain:
Strong-temper‚Äôd steel his stronger strength obey‚Äôd,
Yet was he servile to my coy disdain.       
O! be not proud, nor brag not of thy might,
For mastering her that foil‚Äôd the god of fight.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: ‚ÄòThus he that overrul‚Äôd I oversway‚Äôd,
*   **"he that overrul‚Äôd"**: This refers to Mars, the god of war, who is typically depicted as dominant, powerful, and a ruler over others. Venus is establishing her unique power by contrasting herself with him.
*   **"I oversway‚Äôd"**: Venus states that she overpowered, gained control over, or prevailed against him. "Oversway'd" implies a subtle yet complete dominance, highlighting her ability to manipulate or charm rather than simply conquer by force. Shakespeare uses this to immediately assert Venus's formidable influence.
*   **Meaning:** "Thus, the one who usually dominates others, I dominated."

---

### Line 2: Leading him prisoner in a red-rose chain:
*   **"Leading him prisoner"**: This reinforces the idea of Mars's complete subjugation to Venus. It's a striking image, depicting a powerful god, usually free and commanding, now captive.
*   **"in a red-rose chain"**: This is a powerful and paradoxical metaphor. Red roses symbolize intense love, passion, and beauty. By forming a "chain" from them, Shakespeare suggests that love's allure, Venus's beauty, and her passionate nature are the very things that can bind even the mightiest. The fragility of roses contrasted with the strength of chains highlights the unexpected and inescapable power of love and desire.
*   **Meaning:** "I led him, the powerful god, as my captive, bound by a chain made of red roses."

---

### Line 3: Strong-temper‚Äôd steel his stronger strength obey‚Äôd,
*   **"Strong-temper‚Äôd steel"**: Refers to hardened, durable steel, typically used for weapons and armor. It symbolizes the implements of war and Mars's domain, representing brute, unyielding force.
*   **"his stronger strength obey‚Äôd"**: This describes how even the most formidable objects of war (strong-temper'd steel) were utterly subject to Mars's immense physical power and will. This line emphasizes Mars's usual, overwhelming might, setting up a stark contrast for the next line.
*   **Meaning:** "Weapons made of hardened steel were always obedient to his immense strength."

---

### Line 4: Yet was he servile to my coy disdain.
*   **"Yet was he servile"**: "Servile" means extremely submissive, like a slave. The word "Yet" creates a strong contrast, emphasizing the surprising paradox: a god of war, capable of commanding steel, was utterly subservient.
*   **"to my coy disdain"**: "Coy" means feigned shyness or modesty, often with a hint of flirtation or teasing. "Disdain" here refers to a subtle refusal, a deliberate aloofness, or a teasing rejection. Venus is claiming that her subtle, almost playful resistance or coldness was enough to make the mighty Mars her slave. Shakespeare uses this to illustrate that her power is not physical force, but a nuanced, psychological, and sexual allure that can conquer even the strongest.
*   **Meaning:** "Yet, despite all his power, he became completely submissive to my feigned modesty and subtle refusal."

---

### Line 5: O! be not proud, nor brag not of thy might,
*   **"O! be not proud, nor brag not of thy might"**: This is a direct, emphatic admonition from Venus to Adonis. "Brag not" is an emphatic double negative. She is warning him against the arrogance of his independence and his reliance on his own strength to resist her advances. This marks a shift, applying her past conquest to Adonis's current situation.
*   **Meaning:** "Oh! Do not be arrogant, and do not boast about your own strength,"

---

### Line 6: For mastering her that foil‚Äôd the god of fight.
*   **"For mastering her"**: This refers to Adonis's current actions of trying to resist or overcome Venus, who is speaking.
*   **"that foil‚Äôd the god of fight"**: "Foiled" means to defeat or prevent someone from accomplishing their aim. "The god of fight" is Mars. Venus here reiterates her claim of having defeated or overcome Mars, the epitome of masculine strength and aggression. This serves as a powerful warning to Adonis: if she can conquer Mars, his resistance is utterly futile against her.
*   **Meaning:** "Because you are attempting to overcome me, who previously defeated the god of war (Mars)."

| Allusion           | "he that overrul‚Äôd," "god of fight"          | Refers to Mars, the god of war, immediately establishing the immense power of the figure Venus claims to have subdued, thereby elevating her own prowess and making her claim more impressive.                                                                                                            |
| Metaphor           | "red-rose chain"                             | Compares love/beauty to a binding chain. It highlights the paradoxical nature of Venus's power: seemingly gentle and beautiful, yet strong enough to subjugate even a god. It symbolizes love's ability to entrap and control.                                                                        |
| Paradox / Irony    | "Strong-temper‚Äôd steel his stronger strength obey‚Äôd, / Yet was he servile to my coy disdain." | Juxtaposes Mars's overwhelming strength and control over the instruments of war with his complete submission to Venus's subtle, non-physical power. This highlights the unexpected and illogical nature of love's dominion over brute force.                                                                          |
| Hyperbole          | Venus's account of conquering Mars           | Exaggerates Venus's power over the god of war to impress and intimidate Adonis, underscoring the futility of his resistance against her overwhelming allure and will.                                                                                                                             |
| Apostrophe         | "O! be not proud, nor brag not of thy might," | A direct address to Adonis, breaking the narrative to deliver a personal warning and command. It makes the persuasion more forceful and immediate, directly challenging Adonis's pride and independence.                                                                                               |
| Antithesis         | "overrul‚Äôd I oversway‚Äôd"; "Strong-temper‚Äôd steel" vs. "red-rose chain"; "stronger strength" vs. "coy disdain" | Creates stark contrasts between concepts (dominance vs. submission, physical strength vs. alluring subtlety, war vs. love). This emphasizes the surprising and unexpected nature of Venus's power, which operates on a different, more potent level than mere physical might.                                                 |
| Double Negative    | "nor brag not"                               | Used for emphasis, making the warning against boasting even more forceful and direct. It underscores the urgency and seriousness of Venus's admonition to Adonis.                                                                                                                                |

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

Stanza 19 is a masterful rhetorical maneuver by Venus, designed to dismantle Adonis's resistance by establishing her unparalleled power and desirability. She recounts her conquest of Mars, the formidable god of war, as a cautionary tale. This anecdote serves multiple purposes:

Firstly, it vividly illustrates the central theme of the poem: **the triumph of love (or lust) over brute strength**. By depicting Mars, the embodiment of masculine power and aggression, as a "prisoner" bound by "red-rose chains" and "servile to my coy disdain," Venus demonstrates that her unique form of power ‚Äî rooted in beauty, allure, and subtle manipulation ‚Äî can subdue even the most formidable forces. This directly contrasts with Adonis's youthful, untamed strength and his preference for the hunt.

Secondly, the stanza highlights the **power of persuasion and rhetoric** within the poem. Venus employs flattery (implied by her desire for Adonis), self-aggrandizement, and a thinly veiled threat. She positions herself as an irresistible force, making Adonis's continued refusal seem foolish and futile. Her "coy disdain" signifies that her power is not based on physical force but on a psychological and emotional dominion, making her even more dangerous to Adonis's independence.

Finally, in the broader context of *Venus and Adonis*, this stanza deepens the characterization of Venus as a relentless and formidable pursuer. It underscores the theme of **gender roles and the dynamics of desire**, as Venus actively asserts her dominance over a male figure, subverting traditional expectations. Her warning to Adonis ‚Äî "O! be not proud, nor brag not of thy might, / For mastering her that foil‚Äôd the god of fight" ‚Äî is a direct challenge to his perceived autonomy. It foreshadows the ongoing struggle between Venus's passionate advances and Adonis's chaste rejection, emphasizing that he is up against an ancient, overwhelming force that has already conquered the mightiest of gods. This encounter reveals the inescapable, binding nature of desire for those who fall under its spell, regardless of their own strength or will.
