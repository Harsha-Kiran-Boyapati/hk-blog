## üìñ Original Stanza
```
'The tender spring upon thy tempting lip    
Shows thee unripe, yet mayst thou well be tasted:
Make use of time, let not advantage slip;
Beauty within itself should not be wasted:
Fair flowers that are not gather'd in their prime
Rot and consume themselves in little time.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: "'The tender spring upon thy tempting lip"
*   **"tender spring"**: The soft, youthful growth or bloom on Adonis's lip‚Äîlikely referring to the first downy hair of adolescence or the fresh, soft quality of young lips. "Spring" suggests new growth, youth, and the season of beginning.
*   **"thy tempting lip"**: Adonis's lip is described as alluring and seductive. Venus finds even his youth and inexperience sexually appealing. The word "tempting" reveals her desire while acknowledging the provocative nature of his beauty.
*   **Meaning:** "The soft, youthful bloom on your alluring lip"

---

### Line 2: "Shows thee unripe, yet mayst thou well be tasted:"
*   **"Shows thee unripe"**: Indicates that Adonis is not yet fully mature‚Äîsexually or emotionally. "Unripe" compares him to fruit that hasn't reached full maturity. This acknowledges his youth and inexperience.
*   **"yet mayst thou well be tasted"**: Despite his immaturity, Venus argues he can still be "tasted"‚Äîa euphemism for sexual experience. She suggests that even unripe fruit can be enjoyed, making a case for early sexual initiation.
*   **Meaning:** "Shows you are not yet mature, but you could still be enjoyed:"

---

### Line 3: "Make use of time, let not advantage slip;"
*   **"Make use of time"**: A call to seize the present moment, to not waste the opportunity of youth. This reflects the classical "carpe diem" theme‚Äîseize the day.
*   **"let not advantage slip"**: Don't allow this favorable opportunity to pass by. Venus presents their current situation as advantageous‚Äîhis youth and beauty, her presence and desire‚Äîand warns against letting it escape.
*   **Meaning:** "Take advantage of this moment, don't let this opportunity pass by;"

---

### Line 4: "Beauty within itself should not be wasted:"
*   **"Beauty within itself"**: Beauty that remains unexpressed, unshared, or unused. Venus argues that beauty has no value if it exists only for itself without being appreciated or experienced by others.
*   **"should not be wasted"**: Venus presents this as a moral imperative‚Äîthat beauty has an obligation to be shared and enjoyed. This reflects Renaissance ideas about the duty of beautiful people to reproduce or share their gifts.
*   **Meaning:** "Beauty that serves only itself is wasteful:"

---

### Line 5: "Fair flowers that are not gather'd in their prime"
*   **"Fair flowers"**: Beautiful flowers, a metaphor for Adonis in his youth and beauty. This continues the natural imagery comparing him to natural beauty.
*   **"not gather'd in their prime"**: Not picked or enjoyed when they are at their peak of beauty and perfection. "Prime" refers to the optimal moment of beauty and vitality.
*   **Meaning:** "Beautiful flowers that are not picked when they're at their most perfect"

---

### Line 6: "Rot and consume themselves in little time."
*   **"Rot and consume themselves"**: Decay and waste away from within. This suggests that unused beauty becomes self-destructive, turning inward and destroying itself.
*   **"in little time"**: Quickly, soon. Venus emphasizes the brevity of youth and beauty, the rapid passage from prime to decay.
*   **Meaning:** "Decay and waste away from within very quickly."

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza represents Venus's most sophisticated philosophical argument for seduction, moving beyond mere flattery or physical desire to present a moral and aesthetic case for sexual experience. She employs the classic "carpe diem" (seize the day) argument that was popular in Renaissance love poetry.

**The Philosophy of Use vs. Waste**: Venus argues that beauty and youth have an obligation to be experienced and shared. This reflects Renaissance Neo-Platonic ideas about beauty as a divine gift that should not be hoarded. Her argument suggests that celibacy or chastity is actually a form of selfishness or waste.

**Natural Metaphors and Mortality**: The flower and fruit imagery emphasizes the natural cycle of bloom, prime, and decay. Venus uses this to argue that there is a natural "right time" for sexual experience, and that missing this window leads to loss and regret.

**The "Unripe" Paradox**: Venus acknowledges Adonis's youth and inexperience ("unripe") but argues this doesn't disqualify him from sexual experience. This is psychologically sophisticated‚Äîshe's not denying his immaturity but reframing it as part of his appeal.

**Temporal Urgency**: The stanza creates a sense of urgency through time-related imagery: "spring," "time," "advantage slip," "prime," "little time." Venus presents their encounter as a unique moment that won't come again.

**Gender and Power Dynamics**: Venus positions herself as the experienced teacher who can help Adonis avoid the waste of unused beauty. This reverses traditional gender roles where men typically initiated women into sexual experience.

**Moral Manipulation**: Venus cleverly frames her sexual desire as a moral argument‚Äîshe's not being selfish in pursuing him, but rather saving him from wasting his natural gifts. This is sophisticated rhetorical manipulation.

**Foreshadowing**: The imagery of flowers that "rot and consume themselves" ironically foreshadows Adonis's actual fate in the poem. His refusal to embrace love does ultimately lead to his destruction, though through hunting rather than unused beauty.

This stanza shows Venus at her most intellectually persuasive, using philosophy, natural law, and moral argument to support her physical desire. It represents the height of her rhetorical powers and demonstrates why she was considered a dangerous seductress‚Äîher arguments are almost impossible to refute logically, even when emotionally unwelcome.
