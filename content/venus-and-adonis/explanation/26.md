## üìñ Original Stanza
```
‚ÄòWitness this primrose bank whereon I lie;  
These forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me;
Two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky,
From morn till night, even where I list to sport me:
Is love so light, sweet boy, and may it be
That thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee?
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: ‚ÄòWitness this primrose bank whereon I lie;
*   **"Witness"**: An imperative verb, meaning "observe" or "take notice of." Shakespeare chooses this to directly engage Adonis, commanding his attention and inviting him to acknowledge the sensual scene Venus has created.
*   **"primrose bank"**: A bank or slope covered with primroses. Primroses are delicate, early spring flowers, often associated with youth, new beginnings, and beauty. The "bank" suggests a soft, natural couch. Shakespeare uses this image to evoke a gentle, inviting, and sensual setting, contrasting with the ruggedness Adonis prefers.
*   **"whereon I lie"**: Emphasizes Venus's position of repose and vulnerability, but also allure. It's an invitation for Adonis to approach and join her in this idyllic setting.
*   **Meaning:** "Look at and acknowledge this bank of primroses on which I am lying."

### Line 2: These forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me;
*   **"forceless flowers"**: Flowers are inherently delicate and lack physical strength or force. The adjective "forceless" emphasizes their fragility. Shakespeare highlights this to set up the paradox that follows.
*   **"like sturdy trees support me"**: A simile that creates a paradox. The weak (flowers) are compared to the strong (trees) in their ability to support Venus. This illustrates Venus's divine lightness ‚Äì she is so weightless that even fragile flowers can support her as if they were robust trees. It also subtly suggests that love, though seemingly delicate, can be profoundly supportive and enduring, just like sturdy trees.
*   **Meaning:** "These weak and delicate flowers support me as if they were strong, solid trees."

---

### Line 3: Two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky,
*   **"Two strengthless doves"**: Doves are traditionally associated with Venus as symbols of love, peace, and gentleness. "Strengthless" emphasizes their small, delicate nature. Shakespeare uses this to further underscore Venus's divine attributes and the effortless nature of her movement.
*   **"will draw me through the sky"**: A direct allusion to Venus's mythological chariot, which is often depicted as being drawn by doves. This demonstrates her divine power and ability to traverse vast distances with ease, despite the perceived weakness of her conveyances. It reinforces her argument that true strength and capability can exist even in seemingly 'light' forms.
*   **Meaning:** "Two weak doves are able to pull me through the sky in my chariot."

---

### Line 4: From morn till night, even where I list to sport me:
*   **"From morn till night"**: Indicates a continuous, long duration, emphasizing the tireless and boundless nature of Venus's journeys (and implicitly, her desire and capacity for love).
*   **"even where I list to sport me"**: "List" means to desire or wish. "Sport" here means to amuse oneself, play, or engage in amorous activity. It conveys Venus's freedom, leisure, and readiness for pleasure, suggesting that her movements (and therefore her love) are driven by desire and lead to enjoyment, not effort or burden.
*   **Meaning:** "From morning until night, even to whatever place I desire to go and amuse myself."

---

### Line 5: Is love so light, sweet boy, and may it be
*   **"Is love so light"**: A rhetorical question. "Light" has multiple connotations here: easy to bear, effortless, swift, insignificant, or lacking weight. Venus is presenting love as something that is not burdensome but rather easy and enjoyable. Shakespeare uses this to introduce the central conflict of Adonis's perception.
*   **"sweet boy"**: An endearing and persuasive term of address. Venus uses this affectionate phrase to soften Adonis's resistance and appeal to his youth and tenderness, aiming to disarm his rigid stance.
*   **"and may it be"**: Expresses a sense of rhetorical wonder or disbelief, setting up the contrast with the subsequent line and emphasizing the perceived absurdity of Adonis's viewpoint.
*   **Meaning:** "Is love truly so easy and effortless, my sweet boy, and is it really possible..."

---

### Line 6: That thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee?
*   **"That thou shouldst think it heavy"**: "Heavy" is the direct opposite of "light," implying a burden, a responsibility, or something difficult and cumbersome. This highlights Adonis's youthful inexperience and his perception of love as an obligation rather than a pleasure. Shakespeare contrasts these two words to underscore the fundamental difference in their understanding of love.
*   **"unto thee"**: Archaic phrasing for "to you."
*   **Meaning:** "...that you would consider it a burden or a difficult thing for you to bear?"

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

Stanza 26 is a pivotal moment in Venus's elaborate seduction of Adonis. She employs a sophisticated rhetorical strategy, drawing on her own divine nature and the ease of her existence to challenge Adonis's reluctance towards love.

The overall meaning is Venus's forceful assertion that love is not a "heavy" burden but a "light," effortless, and pleasurable pursuit. She illustrates this by presenting herself as the epitome of this "lightness": she is so ethereal that delicate primroses support her like sturdy trees, and her celestial chariot is drawn by seemingly "strengthless doves" without effort, "from morn till night." Her very being embodies the effortless joy she proposes love should be.

In the context of the poem, this stanza is highly significant:
*   **Clash of Perspectives:** It starkly highlights the fundamental difference between Venus's mature, sensual understanding of love and Adonis's youthful, inexperienced, and somewhat fearful view of it as a demanding obligation. Venus sees love as freedom and pleasure; Adonis sees it as a constraint on his liberty and passion for hunting.
*   **Venus's Seduction Strategy:** This is a key part of her persuasion. By depicting herself and her world as effortlessly joyous and unburdened, she attempts to dismantle Adonis's preconceived notions that love would be a heavy responsibility. She appeals to his senses (the primrose bank) and his reason, using her divine examples as irrefutable proof.
*   **Theme of Love's Nature:** The stanza explores one of the central themes of *Venus and Adonis*: the contrasting aspects of love (sensual vs. chaste, demanding vs. freeing). Venus champions the liberating and joyful aspect of love, implicitly arguing against Adonis's preference for sterile, unattached pursuits like hunting.
*   **Foreshadowing Resistance:** Despite Venus's compelling argument, Adonis's continued resistance in later stanzas makes her efforts seem tragically futile, underscoring the deep-seated difference in their desires and ultimately leading to the poem's tragic resolution. The stanza sets up this intractable conflict, where Venus's persuasive power, though immense, cannot overcome Adonis's innate aversion to her kind of love.
