## üìñ Original Stanza
```
‚ÄòAlas! poor world, what treasure hast thou lost!
What face remains alive that‚Äôs worth the viewing?
Whose tongue is music now? what canst thou boast
Of things long since, or anything ensuing?
The flowers are sweet, their colours fresh and trim;
But true-sweet beauty liv‚Äôd and died with him.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: ‚ÄòAlas! poor world, what treasure hast thou lost!
*   **"Alas! poor world"**: An exclamation of profound sorrow and pity. "Alas!" expresses lament. "Poor world" personifies the world as a grieving entity, suggesting a universal, rather than just personal, misfortune. "Poor" here means pitiable, unfortunate.
*   **"what treasure"**: A powerful metaphor for Adonis. He is depicted as an invaluable, irreplaceable possession. Shakespeare chooses "treasure" to convey Adonis's immense worth and the magnitude of the loss, not merely as a person but as a source of immense value.
*   **"hast thou lost!"**: Uses archaic second-person singular pronouns and verb forms ("thou" for you, "hast" for have). This is a rhetorical question, implying that the world has indeed lost something of supreme and irreparable value.
*   **Meaning:** Oh, what sorrow! Unfortunate world, what an invaluable treasure you have lost!

### Line 2: What face remains alive that‚Äôs worth the viewing?
*   **"What face remains alive"**: Another rhetorical question. This directly refers to Adonis's unmatched physical beauty. The question implies that no other living face can compare to his.
*   **"that‚Äôs worth the viewing?"**: Emphasizes the unparalleled aesthetic appeal of Adonis. "Worth the viewing" means worth looking at, worth admiring, or beautiful enough to warrant attention. Shakespeare highlights that Adonis's beauty was not just attractive, but of such quality it commanded admiration.
*   **Meaning:** Is there any face still living that is beautiful enough to be admired?

---

### Line 3: Whose tongue is music now? what canst thou boast
*   **"Whose tongue is music now?"**: A metaphorical rhetorical question. "Tongue" here refers to the voice and speech. Comparing it to "music" implies that Adonis's voice was uniquely melodious, persuasive, or charming, and that no other voice possesses such captivating qualities now.
*   **"what canst thou boast"**: Continues the series of rhetorical challenges to the world. "Canst thou boast" (can you brag/pride yourself) implies that the world has no comparable features or wonders left to proudly display after Adonis's death.
*   **Meaning:** Whose voice is as melodious as music now? What can you (the world) possibly brag about,

---

### Line 4: Of things long since, or anything ensuing?
*   **"Of things long since"**: Refers to any past glories, beauties, or achievements the world might remember or possess.
*   **"or anything ensuing?"**: Refers to anything that might come in the future. "Ensuing" means following or coming after. This phrase extends the challenge across all time, past, present, and future, reinforcing the idea that Adonis's loss is absolute and eternal.
*   **Meaning:** From things that happened long ago, or anything that will happen in the future?

---

### Line 5: The flowers are sweet, their colours fresh and trim;
*   **"The flowers are sweet"**: Refers to the pleasant fragrance of flowers. This line acknowledges the superficial, common beauty that still exists in nature.
*   **"their colours fresh and trim"**: Describes the vibrant appearance and well-ordered, neat quality of the flowers. "Trim" suggests well-arranged or neatly presented. This line sets up a stark contrast with the profound and unique beauty of Adonis in the following line.
*   **Meaning:** The flowers are fragrant, and their colors are vibrant and neat;

---

### Line 6: But true-sweet beauty liv‚Äôd and died with him.
*   **"But true-sweet beauty"**: This is a powerful contrast. "True-sweet beauty" distinguishes Adonis's beauty as something fundamentally deeper, more genuine, and more significant than the mere "sweet" and "fresh" qualities of flowers. It suggests an intrinsic, essential beauty of being, not just outward appearance.
*   **"liv‚Äôd and died with him"**: This phrase emphasizes the absolute finality and irretrievability of Adonis's unique beauty. It signifies that his essence, his true aesthetic and moral perfection, was so intertwined with his existence that it ceased to be when he did. Shakespeare uses this to underscore the magnitude and irreplaceable nature of the loss.
*   **Meaning:** But authentic and profound beauty lived and perished completely along with him.

| **Hyperbole**        | The assertion that no face, no voice, no past or future thing can compare to what was lost.                | Exaggerates the perfection and irreplaceability of Adonis, reflecting the overwhelming and irrational nature of Venus's grief.                                      |

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza (180) is a pivotal moment following Venus's discovery of Adonis's death. It serves as Venus's lament, projecting her personal, overwhelming grief onto the entire world, signaling a fundamental shift from the poem's initial themes of passionate pursuit to profound sorrow.

**Overall Meaning:** The stanza conveys that with Adonis's death, the world has lost its most precious and incomparable beauty. Nothing remaining, neither past glories nor future prospects, can ever equal what was lost. The superficial beauty of nature (like flowers) pales in comparison to the essential, profound beauty that Adonis embodied, which has now vanished forever.

**Significance in the Context of the Poem:**
*   **Culmination of Loss:** This stanza powerfully articulates the ultimate consequence of Venus's unfulfilled desire and Adonis's tragic end. It's the moment where the poem's underlying tension between love and death, desire and destruction, fully erupts into despair.
*   **Thematic Shift:** It marks a distinct shift from the initial, vibrant portrayal of Venus's passionate pursuit of Adonis to a somber meditation on loss, the transience of beauty, and the finality of death.
*   **Nature of Beauty:** The stanza profoundly explores the theme of beauty. It distinguishes between common, accessible beauty (flowers) and a unique, intrinsic, and ultimately fragile "true-sweet beauty" embodied by Adonis. His death suggests that true beauty is not merely external or enduring, but can be extinguished, leading to an impoverished world.
*   **Irreplaceability and Despair:** Venus's rhetorical questions underscore the theme of irreplaceability. Her inability to conceive of anything else in the world that can fill Adonis's void highlights the depth of her despair and the absolute nature of the loss. This also speaks to the intense, almost obsessive, nature of her love.
*   **Consequence of Unrequited Love (indirectly):** While Adonis's death is by the boar, this lament implicitly reinforces the tragic outcome of Venus's unrequited desire. Her devotion, though ultimately futile in life, now translates into monumental grief in death, showing the devastating power of love's object lost.
