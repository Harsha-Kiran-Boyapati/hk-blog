```
He wrings her nose, he strikes her on the cheeks,
He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard,        
He chafes her lips; a thousand ways he seeks
To mend the hurt that his unkindness marr‚Äôd:
He kisses her; and she, by her good will,
Will never rise, so he will kiss her still.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: "He wrings her nose, he strikes her on the cheeks,"
*   **"wrings her nose"**: This action, rather than being violent, suggests a gentle twisting or pinching motion, typical of attempts to rouse someone from unconsciousness or deep sleep. It indicates Adonis's initial, fumbling attempts to provoke a reaction or bring Venus back to awareness.
*   **"strikes her on the cheeks"**: Similar to "wrings her nose," this implies a light tap or slap, not an aggressive blow, again in the context of resuscitation or rousing. It underscores his panic and desperate, almost instinctual, efforts to revive her.
*   **Meaning:** He gently pinches her nose and lightly taps her cheeks in an attempt to make her regain consciousness.

### Line 2: "He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard,"
*   **"bends her fingers"**: This action implies checking for rigidity or attempting to restore movement, a fumbling but concerned effort to ascertain her state and revive her. It's another sign of his frantic attempts to get a response.
*   **"holds her pulses hard"**: "Hard" here means with focused intensity and concentration, rather than a tight, painful grip. Adonis is pressing firmly to feel for a heartbeat or pulse, highlighting his profound anxiety and the urgency of the situation.
*   **Meaning:** He flexes her fingers and intently presses her wrist to check for a pulse.

---

### Line 3: "He chafes her lips; a thousand ways he seeks"
*   **"chafes her lips"**: To rub her lips, likely to warm them or to bring back color, another traditional method of revival or showing care for someone who has fainted. It's a tender, intimate gesture, driven by his fear for her well-being.
*   **"a thousand ways he seeks"**: This is an example of hyperbole, emphasizing the sheer number and frantic nature of Adonis's attempts to revive Venus. It conveys his overwhelming desperation, guilt, and the intensity of his efforts.
*   **Meaning:** He rubs her lips to warm them; he tries countless different methods to bring her back to consciousness.

---

### Line 4: "To mend the hurt that his unkindness marr‚Äôd:"
*   **"mend the hurt"**: To repair the damage, alleviate the pain, or restore the well-being. Adonis is attempting to undo the negative consequences of his earlier actions.
*   **"his unkindness marr‚Äôd"**: This directly attributes Venus's current swooning state to Adonis's previous harsh words and rejection. "Unkindness" refers to his coldness and refusal of her advances, and "marr'd" means spoiled, damaged, or injured. This line makes his guilt explicit.
*   **Meaning:** To repair the emotional and physical damage that his earlier harshness and rejection had caused her.

---

### Line 5: "He kisses her; and she, by her good will,"
*   **"He kisses her"**: This action is the culmination of his desperate efforts, a tender and desperate kiss, born out of concern and perhaps even a dawning affection, rather than his previous aversion or lust.
*   **"by her good will"**: This phrase means "if she had her own desire" or "by her own choice." It subtly reveals Venus's agency and the fact that her continued unconsciousness is, at least in part, a deliberate choice or wish on her part.
*   **Meaning:** He then kisses her; and if she had her own wish or choice,

---

### Line 6: "Will never rise, so he will kiss her still."
*   **"Will never rise"**: She would never get up from her swoon. This is Venus's internal thought or desire.
*   **"so he will kiss her still"**: "Still" here means "continuously" or "always." This reveals Venus's manipulative tactic: she is prolonging her feigned unconsciousness specifically to ensure that Adonis continues to kiss her. She uses his guilt and concern to her advantage.
*   **Meaning:** She would never regain consciousness, as long as he continues to kiss her.

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza marks a pivotal moment in the narrative, immediately following Venus's dramatic swoon caused by Adonis's harsh rejection. It vividly portrays Adonis's panicked reaction as he genuinely fears he has caused her irreparable harm. His frantic and varied attempts to revive her ‚Äì from physically probing her to tenderly chafing her lips and ultimately kissing her ‚Äì demonstrate a profound and sudden shift from his previous cold disdain to a desperate concern born of guilt. This reveals his youthful inexperience and the overwhelming burden of responsibility he suddenly feels for Venus's state.

Crucially, the stanza also reveals the cunning and strategic depth of Venus. While her initial swoon might have been a genuine physical reaction to distress, the final two lines unveil her manipulative brilliance. Her desire to "never rise, so he will kiss her still" indicates that she is consciously prolonging her feigned unconsciousness. She masterfully exploits Adonis's guilt and newfound tenderness to ensure continuous physical intimacy and affection, transforming her vulnerability into a powerful tool of seduction and control.

In the broader context of the poem, this stanza deepens the exploration of love's complexities and the intricate power dynamics between the two characters. It highlights the transformation of Adonis from a detached, indifferent youth to a momentarily caring figure, albeit driven by fear and remorse. For Venus, it reinforces her proactive, almost predatory, nature in pursuing love, demonstrating her willingness to use every available means, including feigned weakness, to achieve her desires. This interplay foreshadows the ongoing push-and-pull between their contrasting views on love and desire ‚Äì Adonis's resistance versus Venus's insistent passion ‚Äì and underscores her ability to bend circumstances to her will.
