## üìñ Original Stanza
```
'My tongue cannot express my grief for one,        
And yet,' quoth she, 'behold two Adons dead!
My sighs are blown away, my salt tears gone,
Mine eyes are turn'd to fire, my heart to lead:    
Heavy heart's lead, melt at mine eyes' red fire!
So shall I die by drops of hot desire.

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza presents Venus's attempt to understand and express the paradoxical nature of her grief, using alchemical and elemental imagery to describe the internal transformation caused by overwhelming loss.

**The Inadequacy of Language**: Venus begins by acknowledging that language fails her‚Äîher "tongue cannot express" her grief. This reflects the Renaissance understanding that the deepest emotions transcend verbal expression.

**The Mystery of "Two Adons"**: The reference to seeing "two Adons dead" likely refers to seeing Adonis's corpse reflected in her tears or in water, creating a doubled image of loss. This doubles her grief by multiplying the visual evidence of her loss.

**Physical Exhaustion of Grief**: Venus has literally run out of the normal expressions of grief‚Äîher sighs are "blown away" and tears are "gone." This shows grief so intense it has exhausted even natural emotional responses.

**Elemental Transformation**: The transformation of eyes to fire and heart to lead creates a powerful contrast between hot and cold, light and heavy, active and passive. This reflects the internal division of her grief.

**Alchemical Imagery**: The command for her leaden heart to melt in the fire of her eyes references alchemical processes where base metals are transformed by fire. Venus seeks emotional transformation through her own internal heat.

**Self-Directed Commands**: Venus's apostrophe to her own heart shows the fragmentation of grief‚Äîshe's divided against herself, trying to force her own emotional healing.

**Death by Degrees**: The final image of dying "by drops of hot desire" suggests that Venus will be consumed gradually by her own passion, melting away like metal in fire.

**The Paradox of Hot and Cold**: While her eyes burn with fire, her heart is cold lead‚Äîthis paradox reflects the contradictory nature of grief, which can be both numbing and consuming.

**Transformation Through Suffering**: The alchemical imagery suggests that Venus's suffering might transform her, just as fire transforms base metals. Her grief becomes a process of internal change.

**The Physics of Emotion**: Shakespeare uses physical laws (fire melts lead) to describe emotional processes, making abstract grief concrete and scientifically observable.

This stanza shows Venus grappling with grief that has moved beyond normal expression into a realm of physical and elemental transformation, where emotion becomes a force of nature capable of changing matter itself.
