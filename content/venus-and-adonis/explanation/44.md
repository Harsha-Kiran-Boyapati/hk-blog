## üìñ Original Stanza
```
But lo! from forth a copse that neighbours by,
A breeding jennet, lusty, young, and proud,
Adonis‚Äô tramping courier doth espy,
And forth she rushes, snorts and neighs aloud:
The strong-neck‚Äôd steed, being tied unto a tree,
Breaketh his rein, and to her straight goes he.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: "But lo! from forth a copse that neighbours by,"
*   **"But lo!"**: An archaic exclamation meaning "But behold!" or "Look!". Shakespeare uses it to signal a sudden, dramatic reveal or shift in attention, drawing the reader's eye to an unexpected event.
*   **"from forth"**: An archaic prepositional phrase meaning "from out of" or "out from".
*   **"a copse"**: A small wood or thicket of trees.
*   **"that neighbours by"**: That is nearby or adjacent. "Neighbours" is used here as a verb, indicating proximity.
*   **Meaning:** "But look! From out of a small wood that is nearby,"

### Line 2: "A breeding jennet, lusty, young, and proud,"
*   **"A breeding jennet"**: A female donkey (or sometimes a small, high-spirited horse) capable of reproduction, or one currently in heat/pregnant. "Breeding" emphasizes her fertility and natural reproductive state, aligning with the poem's themes of procreation and desire.
*   **"lusty"**: Full of vigor, strong, healthy, and robust; in this context, it also strongly implies sexual vitality and readiness for mating. Shakespeare chose this word to highlight the jennet's intense, instinctive desire.
*   **"young"**: Emphasizes her prime age for reproduction and her abundant energy.
*   **"proud"**: Here, likely means spirited, magnificent in bearing, or confident in her natural power and instincts, rather than arrogant.
*   **Meaning:** "A fertile female donkey, full of strong sexual desire, young, and spirited,"

### Line 3: "Adonis‚Äô tramping courier doth espy,"
*   **"Adonis‚Äô tramping courier"**: Refers to Adonis's horse, described as a "courier" because it is a fast, traveling mount, and "tramping" suggesting its powerful, heavy gait or perhaps its restless energy. This is the stallion that Adonis uses.
*   **"doth espy"**: An archaic form meaning "does see" or "catches sight of". "Espy" implies seeing something from a distance or noticing it suddenly.
*   **Meaning:** "catches sight of Adonis's powerfully striding horse,"

### Line 4: "And forth she rushes, snorts and neighs aloud:"
*   **"And forth she rushes"**: And she moves forward immediately and forcefully with great speed. "Forth" emphasizes the direct, unhesitating movement.
*   **"snorts and neighs aloud"**: The loud, characteristic vocalizations of a horse or jennet expressing excitement, challenge, or attraction. "Aloud" stresses the powerful, attention-grabbing nature of her calls, signifying her uninhibited, instinctual response.
*   **Meaning:** "And she rushes out, snorting and neighing loudly:"

---

### Line 5: "The strong-neck‚Äôd steed, being tied unto a tree,"
*   **"The strong-neck‚Äôd steed"**: Refers to Adonis's horse, emphasizing its powerful build, particularly its muscular neck, which suggests virility and strength. "Steed" is a noble term for a riding horse, often a warhorse.
*   **"being tied unto a tree"**: Indicates that the horse is currently restrained, literally bound. This sets up the dramatic conflict between its physical restraint and its powerful, natural urges.
*   **Meaning:** "Adonis's powerful, muscular horse, which was tied to a tree,"

---

### Line 6: "Breaketh his rein, and to her straight goes he."
*   **"Breaketh his rein"**: An archaic form of "breaks his rein," meaning the horse breaks free from the bridle or halter that restrains it. This action is pivotal, symbolizing the overwhelming power of instinct over external control.
*   **"and to her straight goes he"**: And immediately goes directly to her. "Straight" means directly, without delay or hesitation. This confirms the powerful, mutual attraction and the stallion's immediate, instinct-driven response to the jennet's call.
*   **Meaning:** "breaks free from his restraint, and immediately goes directly to her."

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza initiates one of the most famous and critically discussed episodes in *Venus and Adonis*: the "horse and jennet" scene. Its overall meaning lies in its powerful, visceral depiction of **unbridled, instinctive sexual desire** in the animal kingdom. The "breeding jennet," full of "lusty" energy, actively seeks a mate, and Adonis's "strong-neck'd steed," equally virile, immediately breaks free from all human restraint to answer her call. Their instantaneous, uninhibited rush towards each other is a stark, natural display of the overwhelming power of reproductive urges.

In the broader context of the poem, this scene is profoundly significant:

*   **Symbolic Parallel to Human Desire:** The horses' passionate pursuit and imminent coupling serve as a direct, explicit parallel to Venus's own intense desire for Adonis. Just as the jennet is driven by powerful natural urges, so too is Venus.
*   **Critique of Adonis's Aversion:** The stallion's immediate, forceful response to the jennet's call‚Äîbreaking his reins to pursue her‚Äîhighlights the perceived "unnaturalness" of Adonis's aversion to love and procreation. The poem suggests that for all creatures, from the lowliest animal to gods, sexual desire is a fundamental, irresistible force. Adonis's youthful resistance stands in stark contrast to this natural order, implicitly criticizing his stance.
*   **Theme of Nature vs. Will:** The stanza underscores the theme of nature's powerful dictates overriding human attempts at control or individual will. The horse, though "tied unto a tree," cannot be restrained when faced with the call of instinct. This mirrors Venus's argument that love (and by extension, lust and procreation) is a natural, inevitable force that Adonis should embrace rather than resist.
*   **Foreshadowing and Irony:** The successful, immediate union of the horses foreshadows what Venus desperately desires but cannot achieve with Adonis, creating a powerful sense of dramatic irony. The animals achieve easily what the goddess of love struggles mightily to persuade a human to do. This episode sets the stage for the escalating frustration of Venus's unrequited love and underscores the poem's central conflict.
