Once more the ruby-colour‚Äôd portal open‚Äôd,
Which to his speech did honey passage yield,        
Like a red morn, that ever yet betoken‚Äôd
Wrack to the seaman, tempest to the field,
Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: "Once more the ruby-colour‚Äôd portal open‚Äôd,"
*   **"Once more"**: Indicates a repetition of an action, specifically Venus opening her mouth again, suggesting persistence or a renewed attempt at persuasion.
*   **"ruby-colour‚Äôd portal"**: A metaphor for Venus's lips and mouth. "Ruby-colour'd" emphasizes their vibrant red hue, symbolizing passion, beauty, and perhaps a hint of danger (like blood). "Portal" suggests an entrance or gateway, here implying the source of her speech or an inviting aperture.
*   **Meaning:** Venus's intensely red lips opened again.

---

### Line 2: "Which to his speech did honey passage yield,"
*   **"Which"**: Refers back to the "ruby-colour'd portal" (Venus's mouth).
*   **"to his speech did honey passage yield"**: This phrase is somewhat ambiguous. It likely means that her mouth, in its allure, *offered* or *promised* a sweet and inviting context for Adonis's speech, or that her mouth was so enticing it would make any words that passed between them (including his own) seem sweet. "Honey" signifies sweetness, temptation, and potential stickiness or entrapment, while "yield" means to provide or afford.
*   **Meaning:** Her opening mouth, with its alluring sweetness, seemed to invite or promise a sweet reception for Adonis's words.

---

### Line 3: "Like a red morn, that ever yet betoken‚Äôd"
*   **"Like a red morn"**: A simile comparing Venus's "ruby-colour'd portal" to a red morning sky. This introduces an immediate shift in tone from sweetness to ominous foreboding. While beautiful, a red sunrise is traditionally seen as a sign of bad weather.
*   **"ever yet betoken‚Äôd"**: Has always, without exception, signified, foretold, or indicated.

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza functions as a crucial turning point and a powerful piece of foreshadowing within *Venus and Adonis*. It begins by revisiting Venus's physical allure, describing her "ruby-colour‚Äôd portal" opening to yield a "honey passage," suggesting an enticing and sweet invitation. However, this initial pleasant imagery is immediately and dramatically undercut by an extended and ominous simile. Venus's beautiful mouth is compared to a "red morn," a natural phenomenon traditionally associated with impending disaster.

The detailed enumeration of the "red morn's" destructive consequences ‚Äì "wrack to the seaman," "tempest to the field," "sorrow to shepherds," "woe unto the birds," and "gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds" ‚Äì creates a pervasive sense of doom. This comparison directly links Venus's seductive beauty and persistent advances to the inevitable tragedy that will befall Adonis. Her passion, though seemingly sweet and alluring, is implicitly framed as a destructive force of nature, much like a violent storm.

In the broader context of the poem, this stanza highlights the destructive potential of uncontrolled desire and mismatched love. Venus's pursuit of Adonis, despite her beauty and passionate arguments, is not presented as benign but as a harbinger of suffering. It firmly establishes the poem's tragic arc, moving beyond a simple narrative of unrequited love to a deeper exploration of desire's capacity to lead to "wrack" and "woe." This foreshadowing underscores Adonis's ultimate death, implying that Venus's very allure, symbolized by her "ruby-colour'd portal," carries the seeds of his destruction, making her not merely a lover but an unwitting agent of his grim destiny.
