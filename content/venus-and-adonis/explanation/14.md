Look how he can, she cannot choose but love;
And by her fair immortal hand she swears,

Which long have rain‚Äôd, making her cheeks all wet;
And one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt.

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza is pivotal in establishing Venus's overwhelming and all-consuming passion for Adonis. It starkly portrays her as being utterly captivated and compelled by love, to the point of desperation. Her divine status, hinted at by her "immortal hand," is contrasted with her almost mortal vulnerability as she pleads for a single kiss. This highlights a central theme of the poem: the power of love (especially unrequited or unfulfilled love) to humble even a goddess.

The imagery of "contending tears" that have "long have rain'd" vividly conveys her emotional suffering and the depth of her yearning. The metaphor of a "countless debt" that only "one sweet kiss" can "pay" underscores the immense value she places on Adonis's affection and the emotional toll his indifference is taking on her. It frames her pursuit as a kind of emotional transaction, where she has invested everything and seeks only the simplest return.

In the broader context of Venus and Adonis, this stanza sets the stage for the intense, often one-sided, dynamic between the goddess of love and the beautiful, but reluctant, mortal youth. It emphasizes the theme of desire's consuming nature and the pain of unfulfilled longing. It foreshadows the central conflict ‚Äì Venus's passionate pursuit versus Adonis's steadfast rejection of love ‚Äì and reinforces the idea that even divine power cannot command affection, which must be freely given. The stanza deepens the reader's understanding of Venus's character as both powerful and pitiful, driven by an emotion she cannot control.
