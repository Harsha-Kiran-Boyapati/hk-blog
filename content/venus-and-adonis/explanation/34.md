‚ÄòArt thou obdurate, flinty, hard as steel?
Nay, more than flint, for stone at rain relenteth:

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: ‚ÄòArt thou obdurate, flinty, hard as steel?
*   **"obdurate"**: Stubbornly refusing to change one's opinion or course of action; unyielding. Shakespeare uses this strong word to directly challenge Adonis's rigid emotional state.
*   **"flinty"**: Resembling flint in its extreme hardness and unyielding nature. This reinforces the metaphor of Adonis being like an impenetrable stone, incapable of softening.
*   **"hard as steel"**: A common simile for extreme durability and resistance. It emphasizes the extent of Adonis's emotional imperviousness, suggesting an unnatural rigidity.
*   **Meaning:** "Are you unyielding, as hard as flint, and as tough as steel?"

---

### Line 2: Nay, more than flint, for stone at rain relenteth:
*   **"Nay, more than flint"**: Venus emphatically claims Adonis's hardness surpasses even that of flint, highlighting an almost supernatural level of resistance to her pleas.
*   **"for stone at rain relenteth"**: This provides a natural comparison. Even hard stone, when exposed to the persistent action of rain, will eventually soften, erode, or give way. This makes Adonis's refusal to yield appear unnatural and perverse.
*   **"relenteth"**: Yields, softens, or gives way.
*   **Meaning:** "No, you are harder than flint, because even stone eventually softens when exposed to rain."

---

### Line 3: Art thou a woman‚Äôs son, and canst not feel
*   **"Art thou a woman‚Äôs son"**: This is a rhetorical question that appeals to Adonis's fundamental humanity and parentage. It implies that being born of a woman should inherently imbue him with the capacity for tenderness, empathy, and emotional response, particularly love.
*   **"canst not feel"**: Are you unable to experience emotions, specifically love and the pangs of desire? Venus questions his very capacity for human experience.
*   **Meaning:** "Are you truly born of a woman, yet incapable of feeling (emotion)?"

---

### Line 4: What ‚Äòtis to love? how want of love tormenteth?
*   **"What ‚Äòtis to love?"**: What it is to experience the emotion of love. Venus wonders if he truly understands the essence and power of this feeling.
*   **"how want of love tormenteth?"**: How the absence or lack of love causes great suffering and anguish. Venus is expressing her own torment due to his rejection, attempting to make him understand her pain.
*   **"tormenteth"**: Causes extreme pain, anguish, or suffering.
*   **Meaning:** "What is it like to love? And how does the absence of love cause such torment?"

---

### Line 5: O! had thy mother borne so hard a mind,
*   **"O!"**: An exclamation expressing Venus's intense frustration, exasperation, and perhaps a touch of despair.
*   **"had thy mother borne so hard a mind"**: If your mother had possessed such an unyielding, emotionally cold, or stubborn disposition. This sets up a dramatic hypothetical scenario for the next line.
*   **"borne"**: Carried or possessed (in terms of a mental disposition).
*   **Meaning:** "Oh! If only your mother had possessed such an unyielding heart,"

---

### Line 6: She had not brought forth thee, but died unkind.
*   **"She had not brought forth thee"**: She would not have given birth to you. This is a hyperbolic statement suggesting that Adonis's unyielding nature is so contrary to the natural order of human procreation and affection that his own birth would have been impossible if his mother shared his disposition. It implies birth is an act of tenderness.
*   **"died unkind"**: This phrase has a double meaning. It can mean died without having children (without 'kind' or offspring), which was considered a sorrowful or 'unnatural' fate for a woman in that era. Alternatively, it could mean died unmercifully or cruelly, emphasizing the harshness of a mind that could not give way to love and create life. The first meaning, "without offspring," is generally preferred in this context.
*   **Meaning:** "She would not have given birth to you, but rather died without offspring/without kindness."

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

Stanza 34 is a pivotal moment where Venus, the goddess of love, escalates her impassioned plea to Adonis, directly challenging his stubborn resistance to her advances. Her language is charged with frustration, bewilderment, and a touch of desperation. The stanza's overall meaning centers on Venus's attempt to shame Adonis into feeling by portraying his emotional imperviousness as an unnatural, almost inhuman trait.

Venus opens by likening Adonis to inanimate, unyielding substances‚Äîflint and steel‚Äîthen immediately asserts he is even harder, arguing that even stone eventually yields to the persistent force of rain. This hyperbole serves to highlight the extremity of his rejection and the profound disconnect between his nature and the world's natural order. She then appeals to his very identity, questioning how, as "a woman's son," he can be so devoid of feeling. This rhetorical strategy implies that his birth from a mother should have instilled in him a capacity for love and empathy, making his current state a contradiction of his origins.

The climax of her argument comes in the final lines, where she dramatically claims that if his mother had possessed such a "hard a mind," she would never have given birth to him, but "died unkind." This is a powerful, albeit manipulative, emotional appeal. It suggests that the act of procreation itself requires a yielding, loving nature, implying that Adonis's current disposition is a betrayal of the very maternal kindness that brought him into being. It underscores Venus's belief that love and procreation are fundamental to existence, and Adonis's rejection of them is a form of unnatural deviance.

In the broader context of *Venus and Adonis*, this stanza reinforces several key themes:
*   **The Conflict Between Love and Chastity:** It starkly contrasts Venus's overwhelming, passionate desire with Adonis's resolute, almost ascetic, rejection of love in favor of the solitary pursuit of the hunt. This stanza is a direct confrontation of these opposing forces.
*   **The Nature of Desire and Rejection:** It vividly portrays the torment of unrequited love from Venus's perspective, making her a sympathetic figure despite her aggressive pursuit. Her arguments reveal the depths of her emotional investment and the pain of being denied.
*   **Gender Roles and Power Dynamics:** Venus, the powerful goddess, is reduced to pleading and shaming, highlighting her vulnerability when confronted by Adonis's youthful indifference. It subverts traditional gender roles, with the male Adonis resisting the female's amorous pursuit.
*   **Youthful Ignorance vs. Experienced Passion:** Adonis's inexperience and immaturity are implicitly contrasted with Venus's ancient wisdom regarding love and life's essential impulses. He is presented as naive, not yet understanding the profound "torment" that "want of love" can bring.

Ultimately, Stanza 34 serves to intensify the central dramatic tension, showcasing Venus's mounting desperation and solidifying Adonis's image as an unyielding, almost anti-natural figure, thereby setting the stage for the tragic events to follow.
