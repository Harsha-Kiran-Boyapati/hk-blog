‚ÄòTo see his face the lion walk‚Äôd along     
Behind some hedge, because he would not fear him;

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: ‚ÄòTo see his face the lion walk‚Äôd along
*   **"To see his face"**: This phrase highlights Adonis's extraordinary beauty as the object of intense, almost reverential, observation. It suggests a captivating power so profound that even wild beasts are drawn to behold him.
*   **"the lion walk‚Äôd along"**: The lion, a symbol of ferocity and dominance, is depicted moving in a surprisingly unthreatening manner. "Walk'd along" suggests a gentle, curious approach rather than a predatory stalk, emphasizing the animal's uncharacteristic docility in Adonis's presence.
*   **Meaning:** "To get a glimpse of Adonis's face, the lion would quietly approach."

---

### Line 2: Behind some hedge, because he would not fear him;
*   **"Behind some hedge"**: This detail implies a cautious, almost shy, approach by the lion, not for ambush, but for discreet observation. It shows the lion's unexpected deference and sensitivity towards Adonis.
*   **"because he would not fear him"**: This is a crucial reversal of expectations. The lion's motive for hiding is explicitly not to cause fear in Adonis, demonstrating an unnatural consideration and gentleness from a predator. It underscores Adonis's inherent innocence and the power of his purity to disarm even the most dangerous creatures.
*   **Meaning:** "Concealing himself behind a hedge, specifically so that he would not frighten Adonis."

---

### Line 3: To recreate himself when he hath sung,
*   **"To recreate himself"**: This means to refresh oneself, to find enjoyment, or to be restored. It implies that listening to Adonis is a source of profound pleasure and renewal, even for fierce animals.
*   **"when he hath sung"**: Refers to Adonis singing. This introduces his voice as another powerful element of his charm, complementing his physical beauty and further demonstrating his captivating effect on the natural world. "Hath" is an archaic form of "has."
*   **Meaning:** "To find pleasure and refreshment whenever Adonis had sung,"

---

### Line 4: The tiger would be tame and gently hear him;
*   **"The tiger would be tame"**: The tiger, another emblem of untamed wildness and predatory instinct, is here described as becoming docile and compliant. This is hyperbole demonstrating Adonis's unparalleled ability to pacify and disarm even the fiercest creatures.
*   **"and gently hear him"**: The tiger would listen with a surprising tenderness and quiet attentiveness, completely contrary to its natural predatory behavior. "Gently" reinforces the theme of nature being softened and rendered harmless by Adonis's presence.
*   **Meaning:** "The tiger would become docile and listen attentively and softly to him."

---

### Line 5: If he had spoke, the wolf would leave his prey,
*   **"If he had spoke"**: This expands the influence of Adonis beyond his singing to his mere spoken word, emphasizing the profound and immediate impact of his voice.
*   **"the wolf would leave his prey"**: The wolf, driven by one of the most fundamental animal instincts ‚Äì hunger and the pursuit of survival ‚Äì would abandon its hard-won catch. This image powerfully illustrates the complete disruption of natural order and instinct caused by Adonis's captivating presence.
*   **Meaning:** "If Adonis had simply spoken, the wolf would abandon its kill,"

---

### Line 6: And never fright the silly lamb that day.
*   **"And never fright"**: This emphasizes the complete cessation of predatory behavior. The wolf would not only abandon its current meal but would also refrain from any further aggression.
*   **"the silly lamb"**: "Silly" in this context means innocent, helpless, vulnerable, or simple, not foolish. It highlights the inherent innocence of the lamb, making the wolf's unexpected protection of it even more remarkable and illustrating the profound peace Adonis inspires.
*   **"that day"**: Specifies the duration of this unnatural peace, indicating the immediate and powerful effect of Adonis's influence.
*   **Meaning:** "And would not frighten the innocent, helpless lamb for the remainder of that day."

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza is a testament to Adonis's unparalleled and almost mythical beauty, as passionately described by Venus in her attempt to woo him. It showcases his extraordinary power, not through strength or dominance, but through an innate purity and captivating charm that disarms and pacifies even the fiercest predators in the natural world. Venus presents Adonis as an anomaly: a being whose very presence subverts the laws of nature, transforming savagery into docility, aggression into admiration, and instinct into deference.

In the broader context of *Venus and Adonis*, this description serves several key purposes:

1.  **Elevating Adonis's Allure:** Venus uses this hyperbolic praise to emphasize Adonis's unique and irresistible attractiveness, trying to convince him of his own profound impact, hoping he will then yield to her desires.
2.  **Highlighting Adonis's Innocence and Purity:** The animals' gentle reactions underscore Adonis's inherent purity and lack of malice, which is a core aspect of his character throughout the poem. He is untouched by the worldly passions that consume Venus.
3.  **Contrasting Passions:** This description of Adonis's calming effect on nature stands in stark contrast to Venus's own tempestuous, unbridled passion. She embodies wild, untamed desire, while Adonis represents a calm, pure, and almost chaste beauty that paradoxically tames the wild.
4.  **Foreshadowing and Irony:** The peace Adonis brings to the animal kingdom foreshadows the tragic irony of his death by a wild boar later in the poem. Despite his power to tame animals, he ultimately falls victim to one, highlighting the unpredictable and often cruel nature of fate, and the limitations of even extraordinary beauty against brute force. The stanza also sets up the tragic clash between Adonis's natural purity and Venus's unnatural, overwhelming lust.
