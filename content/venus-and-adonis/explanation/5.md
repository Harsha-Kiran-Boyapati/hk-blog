```
With this she seizeth on his sweating palm,
The precedent of pith and livelihood,
And, trembling in her passion, calls it balm,
Earth‚Äôs sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
Being so enrag‚Äôd, desire doth lend her force
Courageously to pluck him from his horse.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: "With this she seizeth on his sweating palm,"
*   **"With this"**: Refers to Venus's previous attempts to persuade Adonis or her intense emotional state, signaling an immediate, physical follow-up to her internal state or previous actions.
*   **"she seizeth"**: "Seizeth" means to grasp suddenly and forcefully. Shakespeare uses this strong verb to convey Venus's immediate, assertive, and somewhat aggressive physical action, emphasizing her powerful will and determination.
*   **"on his sweating palm"**: This detail provides sensory imagery. Adonis's "sweating palm" suggests his discomfort, nervousness, or perhaps the heat of the moment, indicating his apprehension or reluctance in the face of Venus's intense pursuit.
*   **Meaning:** "Following her intense emotion, she suddenly and forcefully grasps his hand, which is sweaty from nervousness or exertion."

---

### Line 2: "The precedent of pith and livelihood,"
*   **"The precedent"**: In this context, "precedent" refers not to a prior example but to a sign, a token, or an indicator. Venus interprets his palm as a powerful sign of his essential qualities.
*   **"of pith"**: "Pith" signifies strength, vigor, vitality, and the essential core of life. It metaphorically refers to Adonis's youthful virility and energetic essence.
*   **"and livelihood"**: This term emphasizes the living, vibrant essence of his being, encompassing his life force, potential for procreation, and general aliveness.
*   **Meaning:** "She sees his hand as a profound indicator of his core strength, vitality, and life-giving potential."

---

### Line 3: "And, trembling in her passion, calls it balm,"
*   **"trembling in her passion"**: Despite her forceful action, Venus is overcome by the intensity of her desire ("passion"), which causes her to tremble. This illustrates the depth of her emotion‚Äîa mixture of urgent longing and perhaps a physical manifestation of her overwhelming lust.
*   **"calls it balm"**: "Balm" is a soothing, healing, or restorative ointment. Venus perceives Adonis's touch, or his very essence, as something profoundly curative and beneficial to her, suggesting a deep need for his vitality.
*   **Meaning:** "Overwhelmed and physically shaking with her intense desire, she refers to his hand (or the essence it represents) as a soothing and healing remedy."

---

### Line 4: "Earth‚Äôs sovereign salve to do a goddess good:"
*   **"Earth‚Äôs sovereign salve"**: "Sovereign" means supreme, most potent, or preeminent. "Salve" is a medicinal ointment. Venus elevates Adonis's essence to the most powerful and effective form of healing or restoration available on Earth.
*   **"to do a goddess good"**: This phrase emphasizes that the perceived curative power is so immense it can benefit even a divine being like Venus. It highlights her immense longing and the perceived vitalizing force she attributes to Adonis.
*   **Meaning:** "She claims it is the most powerful healing remedy on Earth, capable of restoring and benefiting even a goddess like herself."

---

### Line 5: "Being so enrag‚Äôd, desire doth lend her force"
*   **"Being so enrag‚Äôd"**: Here, "enrag‚Äôd" does not mean angry but rather inflamed or intensified to an extreme degree by passion. It conveys Venus's state of being utterly consumed by her desire.
*   **"desire doth lend her force"**: This is personification, attributing the power to provide strength to an abstract concept. It means her overwhelming desire is the direct source of her physical and mental power, enabling her to act decisively.
*   **Meaning:** "Because she was so intensely consumed by her desire, her passion gave her the necessary strength."

---

### Line 6: "Courageously to pluck him from his horse."
*   **"Courageously"**: Despite any potential resistance from Adonis or the impropriety of her actions, Venus acts with boldness and determination, fueled by her powerful desire.
*   **"to pluck him from his horse"**: "Pluck" implies a sudden, forceful, and somewhat rough action, signifying that she physically pulls him off his horse. This act is both literal and symbolic, as it represents her immediate, assertive interruption of his activity (hunting) and her forceful assertion of control over him.
*   **Meaning:** "This strength allowed her to bravely and forcefully pull him down from his horse."

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza vividly establishes Venus's role as the aggressive and dominant pursuer in the narrative. Her actions, fueled by intense desire, immediately set the tone for the power dynamic between herself and Adonis. The stanza underscores the overwhelming nature of her passion, which is so potent it makes her tremble yet simultaneously grants her the strength to physically impose her will.

Her perception of Adonis's "sweating palm" as "the precedent of pith and livelihood" and a "sovereign salve" reveals her profound fascination with his youth, virility, and potential for procreation. She views him as a source of life and renewal, a "cure" for her divine loneliness or a means to invigorate her own being. This highlights a central theme of the poem: the clash between Venus's overt, physical, and procreative love, which seeks to embrace and consume, and Adonis's chaste, reluctant, and nature-oriented resistance.

The culminating action of "pluck[ing] him from his horse" is highly significant. It is a literal and symbolic interruption of his preferred activity (hunting, which represents his chaste independence and connection to nature) and a direct, forceful assertion of her will. This act immediately establishes Venus's agency and determination, setting the stage for the poem's central conflict where Venus attempts to overcome Adonis's disinterest through persuasion, physical advances, and displays of her power. The stanza thus encapsulates the driving force of Venus's desire and her readiness to act upon it, initiating the central drama of pursuit and resistance.
