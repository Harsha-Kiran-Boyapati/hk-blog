---

## üìñ Original Stanza
```
Whose beams upon his hairless face are fix‚Äôd,
As if from thence they borrow‚Äôd all their shine.    
Were never four such lamps together mix‚Äôd,
Had not his clouded with his brow‚Äôs repine;
But hers, which through the crystal tears gave light
Shone like the moon in water seen by night.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: "Whose beams upon his hairless face are fix‚Äôd,"
*   **"Whose beams"**: Refers to the sun's rays mentioned in the preceding stanza (Stanza 81), which describes the sun "still did beat" upon Adonis's face. Shakespeare chooses this to continue the idea of intense, external light source interacting with Adonis.
*   **"hairless face"**: Emphasizes Adonis's extreme youth and unblemished, smooth complexion, highlighting his innocent and almost childlike beauty. This choice underscores his pre-pubescent state, which contrasts with Venus's mature passion.
*   **"are fix‚Äôd"**: Suggests a sustained and intense focus, as if the beams are captivated or held in place by the beauty they illuminate. It implies an almost magnetic quality to Adonis's appearance.
*   **Meaning:** "The sun's rays are intensely focused on his smooth, youthful face."

### Line 2: "As if from thence they borrow‚Äôd all their shine."
*   **"from thence"**: Meaning 'from that place', referring to Adonis's face.
*   **"borrow‚Äôd all their shine"**: This is an example of personification and hyperbole. It suggests that Adonis's beauty is so radiant and profound that even the sunbeams, the source of light, seem to derive their own brilliance from him. Shakespeare uses this to exaggerate Adonis's extraordinary beauty, making him seem almost divine or supernatural in his allure.
*   **Meaning:** "As if the sunbeams themselves were drawing all their brightness from Adonis's face."

---

### Line 3: "Were never four such lamps together mix‚Äôd,"
*   **"four such lamps"**: A metaphor where "lamps" represent eyes. This refers to the eyes of Adonis (two) and Venus (two) as they gaze upon each other (or at least, Venus gazes upon him). Shakespeare uses "lamps" to convey the idea of eyes as sources of light and expression.
*   **"together mix‚Äôd"**: Implies a coming together or meeting of their gazes, or the combined presence of their expressive eyes. It sets up a comparison of their visual interplay.
*   **Meaning:** "Never were four such brilliant eyes brought together."

---

### Line 4: "Had not his clouded with his brow‚Äôs repine;"
*   **"Had not his clouded"**: Refers to Adonis's eyes becoming dim or obscured. His inherent beauty is marred by his mood. "Clouded" implies a lack of brightness, a shadowing, or a dullness.
*   **"his brow‚Äôs repine"**: "Repine" means to feel or express discontent; to fret or complain. This phrase directly attributes the dimness of Adonis's eyes to his inward displeasure or resistance towards Venus's advances. His emotional state physically manifests as a clouding of his gaze, demonstrating his cold, youthful indifference. Shakespeare uses "repine" to emphasize Adonis's stubborn and unwelcoming attitude.
*   **Meaning:** "If only his (Adonis's) eyes hadn't been dulled by the displeasure evident on his brow."

---

### Line 5: "But hers, which through the crystal tears gave light"
*   **"But hers"**: Introduces a contrast, shifting focus to Venus's eyes.
*   **"crystal tears"**: Describes her tears as clear, pure, and possibly sparkling, like crystal. This suggests that even in her sorrow, Venus maintains a form of beauty and luminescence. Far from obscuring her vision or beauty, the tears seem to enhance the light from her eyes, refracting it like a prism. Shakespeare's choice of "crystal" elevates the tears from mere fluid to something beautiful and luminous.
*   **"gave light"**: Indicates that her eyes, despite or even because of her weeping, still shone brightly. This highlights Venus's emotional intensity and the active nature of her love, even in suffering.
*   **Meaning:** "But her (Venus's) eyes, through her clear, glistening tears, still shone brightly."

---

### Line 6: "Shone like the moon in water seen by night."
*   **"Shone like the moon in water seen by night"**: A vivid simile comparing Venus's tear-filled eyes to the moon's reflection in water at night. This image evokes a soft, diffused, shimmering, and perhaps slightly wavering light. It suggests a melancholic beauty, ethereal and gentle, yet still luminous. The reflection in water often implies a slight distortion or softening, fitting for eyes viewed through tears. Shakespeare uses this simile to convey a sense of poignant beauty and the emotional depth of Venus's unrequited love.
*   **Meaning:** "Her eyes glowed with a soft, beautiful light, like the moon's reflection shimmering in water at night."

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

Stanza 82 beautifully encapsulates the central conflict and character dynamics of *Venus and Adonis*: the clash between passionate desire and cold indifference, and the paradox of beauty.

The first two lines highlight Adonis's almost otherworldly beauty, so profound that it seemingly eclipses even the sun's radiance. This hyperbole reinforces his status as an object of intense desire, a passive figure whose mere existence commands light and attention.

The subsequent lines draw a poignant contrast between Adonis's internal state and Venus's. The metaphor of "four lamps" brings their gazes into direct comparison. Adonis's eyes are "clouded with his brow‚Äôs repine," revealing his youthful sulkiness, his stubborn refusal of Venus's advances. This physical manifestation of his disinterest underscores his inexperience and the frustration of unrequited love.

In stark opposition, Venus's eyes, despite being clouded by "crystal tears," paradoxically "gave light." Her tears, rather than diminishing her beauty, refract and enhance it, shining "like the moon in water seen by night." This simile evokes a soft, ethereal, and emotionally resonant beauty. It suggests that her passion, even in sorrow, is luminous and powerful. It also hints at the inherent beauty of grief and the way deep emotion can transform appearance.

In the broader context of the poem, this stanza is significant for several reasons:
1.  **Reinforces Unrequited Love:** It vividly portrays Adonis's emotional detachment and Venus's profound, yet unreturned, affection, a core theme.
2.  **Beauty and Emotion:** It explores the multifaceted nature of beauty ‚Äì Adonis's passive, almost divine perfection versus Venus's active, emotional, and sorrow-laden allure. It suggests that emotion, even tears, can contribute to a deeper, more poignant form of beauty.
3.  **Visual Dynamics:** The description of their eyes and gazes ("lamps," "clouded," "gave light") emphasizes the visual language of love and desire, which is central to the poem's narrative of pursuit and longing.
4.  **Foreboding:** Adonis's "repine" and dimming gaze subtly foreshadow his ultimate withdrawal and tragic end, suggesting that his beauty is untouchable and ultimately elusive, leading only to Venus's sorrow.
