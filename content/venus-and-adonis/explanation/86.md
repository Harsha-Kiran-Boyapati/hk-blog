'Pure lips, sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted,
What bargains may I make, still to be sealing?

So thou wilt buy and pay and use good dealing;
Which purchase if thou make, for fear of slips
Set thy seal-manual on my wax-red lips.

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza represents Venus's most transactional approach to seduction, transforming romantic love into a commercial negotiation where she offers herself as merchandise in exchange for Adonis's kisses and honorable treatment.

**Love as Commerce**: Venus reframes seduction as a legitimate business transaction, complete with negotiations, payments, and contracts. This makes her pursuit seem rational and mutually beneficial rather than predatory.

**Self-Commodification**: By offering to "sell myself," Venus takes control of her own sexual agency, presenting herself as valuable merchandise rather than a desperate supplicant. This is psychologically sophisticated‚Äîshe transforms potential shame into business pride.

**The Authenticity of Seals**: The seal imagery suggests that Adonis's kisses would authenticate and legitimize their relationship. Just as official seals make documents legal, his kisses would make their love official.

**Permanence Through Documentation**: The commercial metaphor implies lasting commitment‚Äîbusiness contracts endure beyond the moment of signing, suggesting Venus wants permanent rather than temporary attachment.

**Ethical Standards**: Venus's demand for "good dealing" shows she wants honorable treatment, not exploitation. This counters any suggestion that she's offering casual or degraded sexuality.

**Reciprocity and Fair Trade**: The commercial language emphasizes mutual benefit‚Äîshe offers value (herself) in exchange for value (his kisses and honest treatment). This is more dignified than one-sided begging.

**Legal Protection**: The concern about "slips" (errors or fraud) and the need for official seals suggests Venus wants legal protection for their arrangement‚Äîshe's thinking about security and authenticity.

**Color and Sensuality**: The "wax-red lips" imagery maintains the sensual appeal while connecting to the practical imagery of document sealing.

**Power Dynamics**: By positioning herself as a merchant rather than a beggar, Venus attempts to equalize the power dynamic between herself and Adonis.

**Irony of Control**: While Venus presents this as a business negotiation, the reality is that Adonis holds all the power‚Äîhe can refuse the transaction entirely, leaving her with nothing to sell.

This stanza shows Venus's strategic intelligence as she attempts to transform her vulnerable position into one of commercial empowerment, though the underlying desperation remains evident in her willingness to commodify herself for his affection.
