## üìñ Original Stanza
```
So soon was she along, as he was down,
Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
Now doth she stroke his cheek, now doth he frown,
And ‚Äògins to chide, but soon she stops his lips;
And kissing speaks, with lustful language broken,
‚ÄòIf thou wilt chide, thy lips shall never open.‚Äô

### Line 4: "And ‚Äògins to chide, but soon she stops his lips;"

*   **"but soon she stops his lips"**: Venus, quick and assertive, physically prevents him from speaking. This implies either covering his mouth with her hand or, more likely, with a kiss.

*   **"with lustful language broken"**: Her "language" (her words) is "broken" in the sense of being fragmented, breathless, or interrupted by her kisses or overwhelming desire ("lustful"). It conveys the intensity of her passion, which overrides coherent, measured speech. Shakespeare emphasizes the raw, urgent nature of her desire.
*   **Meaning:** And as she kisses him, she speaks, her words fragmented or breathless due to her overwhelming desire.

### Line 6: "‚ÄòIf thou wilt chide, thy lips shall never open.‚Äô"
*   **"If thou wilt chide"**: "Thou wilt" is an archaic form of "you will." This is a direct challenge or condition: "If you intend to scold or rebuke me..."
*   **"thy lips shall never open"**: This is Venus's direct, assertive threat or promise. If he tries to voice his rejection, she will ensure he cannot, implying she will silence him with more kisses or physical closeness. Shakespeare uses this forceful statement to showcase Venus's determined and almost coercive nature.
*   **Meaning:** 'If you intend to scold me, your lips will never be allowed to open.'

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza initiates the direct physical and verbal encounter between Venus and Adonis following her successful pursuit. It immediately establishes the core conflict and power dynamic that will drive much of the poem: Venus's aggressive, passionate desire versus Adonis's youthful innocence, reluctance, and aversion to love.

Venus is portrayed as overwhelmingly assertive and physically dominant. Her actions‚Äîstroking his cheek, stopping his lips, and speaking while kissing‚Äîare all direct attempts to overcome Adonis's resistance. She uses her physical presence and charm to silence his attempts to "chide" or reject her. Adonis, in contrast, is passive and attempts to express his displeasure subtly (frowning) or verbally, but is quickly overridden.

The stanza's climax comes with Venus's direct, almost threatening declaration: "If thou wilt chide, thy lips shall never open." This line underscores her unwavering determination to achieve her desires, signaling that she will use any means, including overwhelming him with kisses, to prevent his refusal. This highlights the theme of obsessive desire and its potential to be coercive or overbearing. It sets the stage for the poem's exploration of the different natures of love: Venus's all-consuming, physical love contrasted with Adonis's chaste, indifferent approach, foreshadowing the inevitable clash between these opposing forces.
