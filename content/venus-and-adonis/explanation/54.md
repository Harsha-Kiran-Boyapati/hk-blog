## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza vividly depicts the sudden and dramatic flight of the horses, specifically the "unback'd breeder" mare and Adonis's own stallion. Driven by an innate fear of capture and an untamed spirit, they escape into the woods with incredible speed, leaving Adonis isolated and frustrated.

In the broader context of *Venus and Adonis*, this event is highly significant. It directly mirrors and reinforces the central theme of **nature's untamability versus human desire and control**. Just as Adonis (the "unback'd" youth) resists Venus's passionate advances, the wild mare refuses to be "backed" or controlled by human will. Her "jealousy of catching" is a parallel to Adonis's "chaste" resistance to love. The horses' successful flight highlights the futility of trying to impose one's will or desire upon something (or someone) that is inherently wild and free.

Furthermore, the stanza serves as an **obstacle and source of frustration** for Adonis. His pursuit of the mare is interrupted, and he is left without his horse, momentarily helpless. This parallels Venus's own frustrations in her pursuit of Adonis. The scene also emphasizes Adonis's **isolation**, a recurring motif that underscores his youthful independence and his resistance to being possessed. By abandoning him, the horses symbolize the broader theme of the unpredictable nature of desires and the difficulty of holding onto what one pursues, whether it be a wild horse or a reluctant lover.
