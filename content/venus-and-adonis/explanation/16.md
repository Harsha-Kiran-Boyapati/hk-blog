## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: "Never did passenger in summer's heat"
*   **"Never did passenger"**: A traveler or someone on a journey. This sets up a comparison using a universal human experience that readers can relate to.
*   **"in summer's heat"**: The intense, oppressive heat of summer that creates overwhelming thirst. This creates a vivid sensory image of physical discomfort and desperate need.
*   **Meaning:** "No traveler suffering in the blazing heat of summer"

---

### Line 2: "More thirst for drink than she for this good turn."
*   **"More thirst for drink"**: The desperate, overwhelming need for water when severely dehydrated. This completes the simile begun in line 1.
*   **"than she for this good turn"**: Venus's desire for Adonis's sexual favor is compared to extreme thirst. "Good turn" is a euphemism for sexual act or favor, suggesting Venus's desire is a matter of survival necessity.
*   **Meaning:** "Ever thirst more desperately for water than she thirsts for his sexual favor."

---

### Line 3: "Her help she sees, but help she cannot get;"
*   **"Her help she sees"**: Venus can see what would relieve her desire‚ÄîAdonis is right there, physically present and available to her sight.
*   **"but help she cannot get"**: Despite his physical presence, she cannot obtain the relief she needs because he refuses to cooperate. The repetition of "help" emphasizes her desperation.
*   **Meaning:** "She can see what would help her, but she cannot obtain it;"

---

### Line 4: "She bathes in water, yet her fire must burn:"
*   **"She bathes in water"**: This continues the thirst metaphor while introducing its paradoxical opposite. She has access to water (Adonis's physical presence, perhaps his tears or resistance).
*   **"yet her fire must burn"**: Despite being surrounded by what should cool her (water), her internal fire of desire continues to burn. This creates a powerful image of unsatisfied passion that cannot be quenched by proximity alone.
*   **Meaning:** "She is surrounded by what should cool her desire, yet her passion continues to burn:"

---

### Line 5: "'O! pity,' 'gan she cry, 'flint-hearted boy:"
*   **"O! pity"**: An exclamation appealing for mercy or compassion. Venus is begging for sympathy from Adonis.
*   **"'gan she cry"**: "'Gan" is archaic for "began." She started to cry out in desperation.
*   **"flint-hearted boy"**: "Flint" is a hard stone that produces sparks when struck but is otherwise cold and unyielding. This metaphor suggests Adonis's heart is hard, cold, and unresponsive to her passion. "Boy" emphasizes his youth and perhaps her frustration with his immaturity.
*   **Meaning:** "'Oh, have mercy!' she began to cry, 'you cold-hearted youth:"

---

### Line 6: "'Tis but a kiss I beg; why art thou coy?"
*   **"'Tis but a kiss I beg"**: Venus minimizes her request, claiming she only wants a simple kiss. This is somewhat disingenuous given her previous aggressive advances and promises of "smothering" him with kisses.
*   **"why art thou coy"**: "Coy" means shy, modest, or reluctant, especially in matters of love. Venus questions why he is being so reserved and resistant to what she presents as a simple request.
*   **Meaning:** "It's only a kiss I'm asking for; why are you being so shy?"

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza marks a crucial moment in Venus's seduction attempt where her frustration reaches a breaking point. The extended thirst metaphor brilliantly captures the torment of unsatisfied desire‚Äîshe can see what she wants but cannot obtain it, creating a psychological and physical agony comparable to severe dehydration.

**The Paradox of Proximity**: The central image of bathing in water while burning with fire represents one of the poem's key themes‚Äîphysical presence without emotional or sexual reciprocation creates more torment than satisfaction. Venus is close to Adonis, can touch him, but cannot kindle the response she craves.

**Escalating Desperation**: Venus's appeal to "pity" shows her strategy shifting from flattery and promises to emotional manipulation. She's beginning to realize that logical persuasion and seductive bargaining aren't working.

**The "Just a Kiss" Strategy**: Venus attempts to minimize her request, presenting herself as asking for something simple and innocent. This is psychologically sophisticated‚Äîby reducing her demand to its smallest component, she tries to make Adonis's refusal seem unreasonable and cruel.

**Adonis as "Flint-hearted"**: The stone metaphor is particularly apt because flint can create fire when struck but remains cold itself. This suggests that while Adonis might have the capacity for passion, he remains emotionally cold and unyielding to Venus's advances.

**Gender Dynamics**: Venus's complaint about Adonis being "coy" reverses traditional gender expectations. Typically, women were expected to be coy and resistant while men pursued. Venus's frustration with this role reversal highlights the poem's exploration of unconventional gender dynamics.

This stanza effectively conveys the mounting psychological pressure Venus feels as her seduction fails. Her comparison to a dying traveler shows that she experiences her sexual frustration as a matter of survival, not mere desire. The poem uses this extreme metaphor to explore how unfulfilled passion can become a form of torment that consumes the lover's entire being.
