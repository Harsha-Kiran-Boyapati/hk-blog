Venus salutes him with this fair good morrow:

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: Venus salutes him with this fair good morrow:
*   **"salutes him"**: Greets him, specifically with a formal or respectful acknowledgment.
*   **"fair good morrow"**: A pleasant or beautiful good morning. "Fair" emphasizes the pleasantness and grace of her greeting, setting a tone of politeness before her passionate plea.
*   **Meaning:** Venus greets Adonis with a pleasant good morning, initiating her speech.

---

### Line 2: ‚ÄòO thou clear god, and patron of all light,
*   **"O thou clear god"**: "Clear" here means bright, radiant, pure, or unblemished. Venus is addressing Adonis with an apostrophe, elevating him to divine status, likening him to a deity or a celestial body. This is a hyperbolic compliment designed to flatter.
*   **"patron of all light"**: A protector, supporter, or ultimate source of all light. This hyperbole positions Adonis as the supreme origin of brightness, surpassing even natural light sources, enhancing the flattery and emphasizing his perceived absolute beauty and radiance.
*   **Meaning:** Oh, you radiant god, the protector and source of all light,

---

### Line 3: From whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow
*   **"From whom"**: Referring back to Adonis, the "clear god" from whom all light originates.
*   **"doth borrow"**: Does borrow. This reinforces the extreme flattery by suggesting that even powerful celestial bodies like stars, or man-made light sources like lamps, derive their brightness from Adonis. It's a metaphor for his overwhelming beauty.
*   **Meaning:** From whom every lamp and shining star takes its brightness,

---

### Line 4: The beauteous influence that makes him bright,
*   **"beauteous influence"**: Beautiful power or emanation. "Influence" carries an archaic meaning related to an ethereal fluid or power believed to flow from the stars (or in this case, Adonis) that affects things on Earth. It refers to the very essence of his beauty and light.
*   **"makes him bright"**: Refers to the "lamp and shining star" mentioned in the previous line, indicating that Adonis's "influence" is what illuminates them.
*   **Meaning:** The beautiful, radiant power that illuminates them,

---

### Line 5: There lives a son that suck‚Äôd an earthly mother,
*   **"There lives a son"**: This is a direct shift in focus from Adonis to Venus's own son, Cupid, though not named explicitly. This serves as an indirect introduction of the concept of love and passion.
*   **"suck‚Äôd an earthly mother"**: A way of describing Cupid's birth, highlighting his connection to the human or mortal realm, despite his divine parentage. This might be Venus's subtle way of making him seem more relatable or less intimidating, or perhaps linking her own maternal role to the earthly experience of love, distinct from the purely celestial portrayal of Adonis she just presented.
*   **Meaning:** There exists a son (Cupid), who was born of an earthly mother (Venus herself, subtly emphasizing her role as a source of earthly love),

---

### Line 6: May lend thee light, as thou dost lend to other‚Äô
*   **"May lend thee light"**: This is the crux of Venus's persuasive argument. The "light" here is metaphorical, referring to love, passion, or emotional enlightenment. Venus implies that Cupid has the power to impart love to Adonis.
*   **"as thou dost lend to other"**: Completing the comparison, Venus suggests that just as Adonis, the source of all literal light, generously bestows it upon others, he might now receive a reciprocal 'light' (love) from Cupid. This serves as a subtle plea for Adonis to open himself to love, presenting it as a natural, balanced exchange.
*   **Meaning:** He might be able to give you light (love or passion), just as you provide light to everything else.

| **Apostrophe** | "O thou clear god, and patron of all light"         | Venus directly addresses Adonis as if he were a deity, elevating him and setting a tone of intense admiration and flattery, which also serves to emphasize her own heightened emotional state.                                                                                                                                               |
| **Hyperbole**  | "patron of all light, / From whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow" | Exaggerates Adonis's beauty and influence to an almost divine degree. This extreme flattery is a rhetorical strategy by Venus to disarm Adonis, highlight his perceived self-sufficiency, and prepare him for her subsequent argument that even he might need 'light' (love).                                                           |
| **Metaphor**   | "light" as love/passion (in "May lend thee light")  | The recurring motif of "light" is used both literally (celestial brightness) and metaphorically (love, passion, emotional insight). This creates a sophisticated conceit where Venus argues that just as Adonis is a source of physical light, he might benefit from the emotional "light" of love from Cupid.                                  |
| **Conceit**    | The extended comparison of Adonis as the ultimate source of light, from whom even stars borrow, and the idea that Cupid can "lend thee light." | This elaborate and extended metaphor frames Adonis's beauty in celestial terms while subtly introducing the idea of love as a reciprocal form of "light." It showcases Venus's persuasive wit and the poem's exploration of desire and beauty.                                                                               |
| **Allusion**   | "There lives a son that suck‚Äôd an earthly mother"  | An indirect reference to Cupid, the god of love. This introduces the concept of love into the dialogue without directly naming the powerful figure, softening its immediate impact while setting up Venus's persuasive argument.                                                                                                    |
| **Irony**      | Venus calling Adonis the "patron of all light" yet asking her son to "lend thee light" | While Venus overtly flatters Adonis's radiant self-sufficiency, there is an underlying irony. Her ultimate goal is to persuade him to accept the 'light' of love, suggesting that even this supreme being might be lacking in that specific emotional aspect, or could benefit from a reciprocal exchange.                                       |

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza marks the crucial beginning of Venus's direct and passionate pursuit of Adonis. Having finally found him after his hunt, she initiates her courtship with a highly elaborate and flattering address. She elevates Adonis to a god-like status, declaring him the "patron of all light" from whom even celestial bodies borrow their radiance. This hyperbole serves a dual purpose: it showcases her overwhelming attraction and admiration for his unparalleled beauty, and it acts as a strategic rhetorical device to disarm him and make him receptive to her subsequent proposal.

The significance of the stanza lies in its introduction of the poem's central conflict and themes. Venus's flattery, while seemingly boundless, is a prelude to her subtle argument that even Adonis, the ultimate source of literal "light," might benefit from the metaphorical "light" of love, personified by her son Cupid. The "light" that Cupid can "lend" Adonis signifies passion, desire, and emotional fulfillment. This introduces the core tension between Adonis's youthful disinterest in love (his "chastity" and self-sufficiency) and Venus's ardent desire to initiate him into the world of sensual love.

The stanza thus sets the stage for the dramatic interplay between persuasion and resistance, passion and purity. It highlights Venus's agency and rhetorical skill, even as it underscores the challenge she faces in converting Adonis from a self-contained beauty to a participant in erotic love. The theme of love's reciprocity (the idea of "lending" and "borrowing" light/love) is also subtly introduced, prefiguring the broader poetic exploration of unrequited love and the transformative power (or lack thereof) of desire.
