## üìñ Original Stanza
```
And, being open‚Äôd, threw unwilling light
Upon the wide wound that the boar had trench‚Äôd
In his soft flank; whose wonted lily white
With purple tears, that his wound wept, was drench‚Äôd:
No flower was nigh, no grass, herb, leaf, or weed
But stole his blood and seem‚Äôd with him to bleed.

### Line 4: "With purple tears, that his wound wept, was drench‚Äôd:"

*   **"seem‚Äôd with him to bleed"**: Personification. The plants appear to be bleeding in sympathy with Adonis, highlighting nature's deep empathy and participation in his suffering.

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza marks the devastating climax of the narrative, depicting the immediate, graphic aftermath of Adonis's fatal goring by the boar. It is a moment of profound tragedy, visually portraying the destruction of beauty and the triumph of violent, uncontrolled force.

The stanza's **overall meaning** is to convey the brutality of Adonis's death and, more significantly, the universal sorrow and empathetic response of nature to this tragic event. The "unwilling light" and the plants "stealing" his blood and "seeming to bleed" with him vividly illustrate that Adonis's demise is not just a personal tragedy but a wound felt by the entire natural world.

In the **context of the poem**, this stanza is highly significant for several reasons:

1.  **Destruction of Beauty and Innocence:** The graphic depiction of the "wide wound" against Adonis's "soft flank" and "wonted lily white" skin underscores a core theme of the poem: the vulnerability of pristine beauty and innocence to destructive forces. Throughout the poem, Adonis embodies chaste beauty resisting Venus's overwhelming desire. His death by the boar, often interpreted as a symbol of uncontrolled, wild passion (ironically, similar to Venus's untamed lust), serves as the ultimate tragic outcome of this resistance and the inherent fragility of such purity in the face of brutal reality.

2.  **Nature's Empathy and Transformation:** The most powerful aspect of this stanza is nature's active mourning. The personification of light and plants mourning alongside Adonis sets the stage for the poem's concluding myth, where Venus transforms Adonis's blood into the anemone flower. This connection between Adonis's death and the natural world signifies that even in demise, his beauty and essence are not lost but transformed and integrated into the cycles of nature. It emphasizes Venus's role as a goddess of fertility and the natural world, suggesting that death can lead to a new form of life or remembrance. The bleeding plants symbolize a shared cosmic grief and foreshadow the poem's ultimate message of beauty's enduring, albeit transformed, presence.

3.  **Thematic Resolution (Tragic):** This stanza delivers the final, inescapable consequence of Adonis's flight from love and the uncontrolled power of desire (represented both by Venus's lust and the boar's ferocity). It resolves the central conflict of the poem in a tragic manner, cementing the idea that unchecked passion (or resistance to natural urges) can lead to devastating outcomes. The raw depiction of the wound forces Venus (and the reader) to confront the stark reality of death, a stark contrast to the earlier playful, erotic, and often philosophical debates about love and chastity.
