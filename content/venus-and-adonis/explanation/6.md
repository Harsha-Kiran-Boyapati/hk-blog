## üìñ Original Stanza
```
Over one arm the lusty courser‚Äôs rein
Under her other was the tender boy,
Who blush‚Äôd and pouted in a dull disdain,
With leaden appetite, unapt to toy;
She red and hot as coals of glowing fire
He red for shame, but frosty in desire.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: "Over one arm the lusty courser‚Äôs rein"
*   **"Over one arm"**: Indicates a casual but firm hold, suggesting Venus has dismounted or is restraining the horse while simultaneously holding Adonis.
*   **"lusty"**: Here, it means strong, vigorous, spirited, full of animal vitality and power. It also carries a subtle undertone of sexual energy, foreshadowing the horse's later actions and mirroring Venus's own desires. Shakespeare chooses this word to immediately establish a powerful, untamed force.
*   **"courser‚Äôs rein"**: The reins of a swift, powerful, and often high-spirited horse, emphasizing the animal's strength and untamed nature.
*   **Meaning:** Venus is holding the rein of the powerful, spirited horse over one of her arms.

---

### Line 2: "Under her other was the tender boy,"
*   **"Under her other"**: Refers to Venus's second arm, indicating she holds Adonis close, almost cradling him or holding him captive.
*   **"tender boy"**: Describes Adonis as young, delicate, gentle, and perhaps vulnerable or inexperienced. This immediately contrasts with the "lusty courser" and highlights his youth and reluctance compared to Venus's aggressive advances.
*   **Meaning:** Beneath her other arm, she held the young and delicate Adonis.

---

### Line 3: "Who blush‚Äôd and pouted in a dull disdain,"
*   **"blush‚Äôd"**: Turned red in the face due to embarrassment, shyness, or modesty. It signifies his discomfort with the situation.
*   **"pouted"**: Pushed out his lips, indicating sulkiness, annoyance, or displeasure.
*   **"dull disdain"**: A muted, listless, or passive contempt or disapproval. "Dull" suggests his resistance isn't fiery or active, but rather a weary, unenthusiastic lack of interest, emphasizing his general apathy towards her advances. Shakespeare uses "dull" to underscore his lack of passion.
*   **Meaning:** Adonis blushed and showed his displeasure with a listless, passive contempt.

---

### Line 4: "With leaden appetite, unapt to toy;"
*   **"leaden appetite"**: A desire (specifically for love or passion) that is heavy, dull, sluggish, and unresponsive, like lead. It signifies a complete lack of enthusiasm or arousal. Shakespeare uses "leaden" to convey the extreme inertia of his desire.
*   **"unapt to toy"**: Not inclined or suitable for playful or amorous interaction. "Toy" refers to flirtation, lovemaking, or lighthearted engagement.
*   **Meaning:** He had no desire for love, being completely disinclined to engage in amorous play or flirtation.

---

### Line 5: "She red and hot as coals of glowing fire"
*   **"red and hot"**: A vivid physical description of Venus, signifying her intense passion, desire, and perhaps her flushed complexion from exertion. "Red" suggests a flushed face, "hot" her internal fervor.
*   **"as coals of glowing fire"**: A powerful simile comparing Venus's passionate state to burning embers, emphasizing her fervent, almost consuming desire and inner heat. Shakespeare uses this to convey extreme, vibrant passion.
*   **Meaning:** Venus was flushed and burning with passion, like hot, glowing coals.

---

### Line 6: "He red for shame, but frosty in desire."
*   **"He red for shame"**: Adonis's redness is explicitly attributed to embarrassment, modesty, or moral discomfort, directly contrasting with Venus's "red" of desire. It highlights his innocence and aversion.
*   **"frosty in desire"**: A striking oxymoron. His desire (or lack thereof) is described as cold, inert, and unwelcoming, like frost. This powerfully contrasts with Venus's "glowing fire" and encapsulates his complete absence of warmth or passion. Shakespeare employs this to perfectly capture his unresponsiveness.
*   **Meaning:** He, on the other hand, was red from embarrassment but completely cold and unresponsive in his desire.

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza is foundational in establishing the central conflict and the dynamic between the two protagonists, Venus and Adonis. It vividly portrays Venus's overwhelming, aggressive, and fiery passion, juxtaposed with Adonis's equally profound, passive, and cold rejection. The physical descriptions are not merely aesthetic but deeply symbolic: Venus's "red and hot as coals of glowing fire" embodies lust and consuming desire, while Adonis's "leaden appetite" and "frosty in desire" symbolize chastity, disinterest, and even revulsion. The contrast in their "redness"‚ÄîVenus's flush of arousal versus Adonis's blush of shame‚Äîhighlights their fundamentally different natures and responses to love and sexuality.

In the broader context of Venus and Adonis, this stanza sets the stage for the poem's exploration of various themes: the predatory nature of love (Venus's pursuit), the conflict between uncontrolled passion and chaste innocence, the pain of unrequited love, and the destructive potential of desire when it is not reciprocated. Adonis's youthful disinterest and attachment to hunting (as implied by his aversion to "toy[ing]") are sharply contrasted with Venus's mature and ardent pursuit of physical love. The initial mention of the "lusty courser" subtly introduces a parallel to Venus's own untamed desires, foreshadowing later events in the poem where the horse's unbridled sexual energy mirrors Venus's and ultimately contributes to Adonis's tragic fate, linking the themes of love, hunting, and death. This stanza firmly roots the narrative in the tension between overwhelming desire and steadfast resistance, which drives the entire poem.
