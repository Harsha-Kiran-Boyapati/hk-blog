## üìñ Original Stanza
```
O! what a sight it was, wistly to view
How she came stealing to the wayward boy;   
To note the fighting conflict of her hue,
How white and red each other did destroy:
But now her cheek was pale, and by and by
It flash‚Äôd forth fire, as lightning from the sky.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: "O! what a sight it was, wistly to view"
*   **"O! what a sight it was"**: This exclamation expresses the speaker's profound wonder, awe, or amazement at the scene he is describing. It signals that what followed was remarkably striking or memorable. Shakespeare uses it to immediately draw the reader into the emotional intensity of the observation.
*   **"wistly"**: An archaic adverb meaning "intently," "attentively," or "earnestly." It suggests a fixed, concentrated gaze or a deep, thoughtful observation. Shakespeare employs this word to convey the deliberate and focused manner in which the speaker, and by extension the reader, is invited to behold Venus's approach, highlighting the significance and captivating nature of the moment.
*   **Meaning:** Oh, what an extraordinary and compelling sight it was, to observe so intently.

---

### Line 2: "How she came stealing to the wayward boy;"
*   **"How she came stealing"**: Here, "stealing" does not imply theft but rather moving quietly, cautiously, or stealthily. It suggests Venus's deliberate and perhaps unobserved approach to Adonis, possibly indicating her eagerness to surprise him or her determination to avoid alarming him before she could make her move. Shakespeare chooses this word to emphasize the cunning or careful nature of her advance.
*   **"the wayward boy"**: "Wayward" means disobedient, headstrong, or resistant to control or advice. In this context, it describes Adonis's character as someone who deviates from the "expected" path of youthful love and instead desires the hunt. Shakespeare uses this adjective to immediately establish Adonis's resistance to Venus's advances, setting up the central conflict of the poem.
*   **Meaning:** Observing how she approached the stubborn and resistant Adonis with a quiet, careful movement.

---

### Line 3: "To note the fighting conflict of her hue,"
*   **"To note"**: To observe closely, to pay attention to.
*   **"the fighting conflict of her hue"**: "Hue" refers to the color of her complexion (her face). "Fighting conflict" personifies the colors on her face, portraying them as if they are in a violent struggle. This vivid imagery describes the rapid and dramatic changes in her skin color, specifically the blush (red) and paleness (white), as a manifestation of intense internal emotion. Shakespeare uses this phrase to powerfully convey Venus's emotional turmoil and the physical impact of her desire.
*   **Meaning:** To observe the intense struggle and rapid changes of color on her face.

---

### Line 4: "How white and red each other did destroy:"
*   **"white and red"**: These colors symbolize the flush of passion, excitement, or embarrassment (red) and the pallor of apprehension, shock, or receding blood (white). They represent the extremes of her emotional state.
*   **"each other did destroy"**: This is hyperbole, an exaggeration. The colors are not literally destroying each other but rather rapidly displacing or overwhelming one another. One color would rush to her face, only to recede quickly, making way for the other. Shakespeare uses this strong verb to emphasize the swiftness and dramatic intensity of these emotional shifts, suggesting a complete takeover by one emotion before another asserts itself.
*   **Meaning:** How the paleness and flush on her face rapidly alternated, each seemingly obliterating the other in its intensity.

---

### Line 5: "But now her cheek was pale, and by and by"
*   **"But now her cheek was pale"**: This specifies one particular moment in the rapid color shifts, indicating a state of paleness. This could suggest apprehension, a momentary loss of composure, or the draining of blood due to intense emotion before a flush.
*   **"by and by"**: An archaic phrase meaning "soon," "presently," or "in a short time." It emphasizes the immediacy and rapid succession of the next emotional and physical change. Shakespeare uses this phrase to maintain the sense of quick, dynamic shifts in Venus's appearance.
*   **Meaning:** But at one moment her face was pale, and then very quickly...

---

### Line 6: "It flash‚Äôd forth fire, as lightning from the sky."
*   **"It flash‚Äôd forth fire"**: This is a powerful metaphor. "Fire" represents an intense rush of passion, anger, determination, or overwhelming desire that causes her face to become flushed and vibrant. It's a sudden, vivid burst of color and energy. Shakespeare uses "fire" to convey the heat and intensity of her emotions.
*   **"as lightning from the sky"**: A vivid simile that compares the sudden, brilliant, and powerful appearance of the flush on her face to a lightning strike. This emphasizes the extreme speed, intensity, and almost overwhelming power of her emotional display. Lightning is sudden, bright, and often associated with divine power or intense, uncontainable energy.
*   **Meaning:** ...her face suddenly flushed with intense passion, appearing as quickly and powerfully as lightning strikes from the sky.

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza is a powerful and vivid depiction of Venus's overwhelming emotional state as she approaches Adonis. Her rapidly shifting complexion, oscillating between paleness and a fiery blush, serves as a physical manifestation of her intense passion, anticipation, and perhaps even a hint of desperation or frustration. The "fighting conflict of her hue" symbolizes the internal battle of her emotions ‚Äì her apprehension and desire, her goddess-like composure struggling against her all-consuming infatuation.

In the broader context of *Venus and Adonis*, this stanza is highly significant:
*   **Characterization of Venus:** It immediately establishes Venus as a creature of immense, almost volatile passion. Unlike the restrained, chaste ideal of love sometimes portrayed, Shakespeare's Venus is driven by an ardent, almost aggressive desire. This raw emotionality is central to her character throughout the poem.
*   **Introduction of Conflict:** The internal "conflict" shown on Venus's face foreshadows the primary external conflict of the poem: her passionate pursuit of Adonis versus his steadfast rejection of love in favor of the hunt. Her fluctuating colors visually represent the battle she is prepared to wage to win him over.
*   **The Power of Desire:** The dramatic imagery underscores the overwhelming, almost uncontrollable power of desire and its physical effects. Even a goddess is made vulnerable and visibly affected by such intense longing, highlighting the universal force of infatuation.
*   **Setting the Tone:** The rapid, intense imagery (fire, lightning) sets an immediate tone of high drama and urgency for the ensuing interaction. It primes the reader for a powerful and eventful encounter between the ardent goddess and the recalcitrant youth.
*   **Themes of Beauty and Imperfection:** While Venus is a goddess of beauty, her face is not serene; it's a battleground of emotions. This suggests that even divine beauty is not static or perfectly composed, but can be disrupted and rendered turbulent by the force of human-like passions, making her more relatable despite her divinity.
