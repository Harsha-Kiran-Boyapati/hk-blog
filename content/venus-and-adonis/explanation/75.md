## üìñ Original Stanza
```
'But O! what banquet wert thou to the taste,        
Being nurse and feeder of the other four;
Would they not wish the feast might ever last,
And bid Suspicion double-lock the door,
Lest Jealousy, that sour unwelcome guest,
Should, by his stealing in, disturb the feast?'

*   **"But O!"**: An exclamation of intense emotion, expressing Venus's overwhelming feelings about taste as a sense.
*   **"what banquet"**: What a feast, what a sumptuous meal. Venus compares the experience of taste to a luxurious, elaborate meal.
*   **"wert thou to the taste"**: You would be to the sense of taste. Venus is addressing taste as one of the five senses, imagining how Adonis would affect this particular sense.

### Line 2: "Being nurse and feeder of the other four;"
*   **"Being nurse and feeder"**: Acting as the caretaker and nourisher. "Nurse" suggests tender care, while "feeder" implies sustenance and satisfaction.
*   **"of the other four"**: Of the other four senses (sight, hearing, smell, and touch). Venus positions taste as the caretaker of all the other senses.
*   **Meaning:** "Since you nourish and care for the other four senses;"

### Line 3: "Would they not wish the feast might ever last,"
*   **"Would they not wish"**: Wouldn't they desire, wouldn't they hope for. This is a rhetorical question assuming the answer is yes.
*   **"the feast might ever last"**: The banquet could continue forever, never end. Venus imagines eternal sensual pleasure.
*   **Meaning:** "Wouldn't they want this feast to last forever,"

### Line 5: "Lest Jealousy, that sour unwelcome guest,"
*   **"Lest Jealousy"**: So that Jealousy won't, to prevent Jealousy from. "Lest" introduces a fear or concern.
*   **"that sour unwelcome guest"**: Jealousy is personified as an unpleasant visitor. "Sour" suggests both bad taste and bitter temperament; "unwelcome" means not wanted.
*   **Meaning:** "So that Jealousy, that bitter and unwanted visitor,"

---

### Line 6: "Should, by his stealing in, disturb the feast?'"
*   **"by his stealing in"**: By sneaking in secretly, by entering without permission. "Stealing" suggests stealth and unwanted intrusion.

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza represents Venus's sophisticated argument about the supremacy of taste (kissing) among the five senses, while also addressing the psychological threats to love. She presents kissing as the ultimate sensual experience that would satisfy all the senses and create a desire for permanence.

**The Hierarchy of Senses**: Venus positions taste as the "nurse and feeder" of the other four senses, suggesting that kissing would be the most fulfilling sensual experience‚Äîone that would enhance and nourish all other forms of pleasure.

**Feast as Metaphor for Love**: The banquet imagery transforms physical love into something luxurious, abundant, and celebratory rather than merely carnal. This elevates her proposal from base desire to refined pleasure.

**The Psychology of Possessiveness**: Venus addresses the natural human tendency toward jealousy and suspicion in love relationships, showing sophisticated understanding of love's psychological complexities.

**Permanence vs. Transience**: The desire for the feast to "ever last" reflects Venus's wish for eternal rather than temporary pleasure‚Äîshe's not offering a brief encounter but lasting satisfaction.

**External vs. Internal Threats**: By personifying Jealousy as an external "guest" who might "steal in," Venus suggests that the real threats to love come from outside rather than from the lovers themselves.

**Security and Privacy**: The image of double-locking doors emphasizes the intimate, private nature of love that must be protected from intrusion.

**Preemptive Argument**: Venus anticipates and addresses potential objections about the complications of physical love by acknowledging jealousy while positioning it as an external threat rather than an inevitable consequence.

**Rhetorical Sophistication**: The use of rhetorical questions makes her audience (Adonis and the reader) complicit in her logic‚Äîshe assumes they will agree that the feast should last forever and be protected from jealousy.

**Irony of Control**: While Venus argues for protecting the feast from jealousy, her own aggressive pursuit of Adonis could be seen as a form of possessiveness that might generate the very jealousy she warns against.

This stanza shows Venus at her most psychologically sophisticated, demonstrating understanding of both the pleasures and perils of love while maintaining her seductive agenda through the appealing metaphor of an eternal, protected feast.
