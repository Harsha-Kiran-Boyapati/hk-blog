Once more the engine of her thoughts began:
‚ÄòO fairest mover on this mortal round,      
Would thou wert as I am, and I a man,
My heart all whole as thine, thy heart my wound;
For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee,
Though nothing but my body‚Äôs bane would cure thee.‚Äô

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: Once more the engine of her thoughts began:
*   **"the engine of her thoughts"**: This is a metaphor comparing Venus's mind or thinking process to a powerful machine or mechanism. "Engine" implies a driving force, something that operates with purpose and power. Shakespeare's choice emphasizes the methodical, persistent, and perhaps even relentless nature of her intellectual and persuasive efforts.
*   **Meaning:** Her mind, or the process of her thinking, started up again with renewed intensity.

---

### Line 2: ‚ÄòO fairest mover on this mortal round,
*   **"fairest mover"**: "Fairest" means most beautiful, referring to Adonis. "Mover" denotes a living being who moves about, emphasizing his physical presence and activity. It also subtly suggests his ability to move away from her advances.
*   **"mortal round"**: Refers to the Earth or the mortal world, often implying the cyclical nature of life and death that mortals experience. "Round" highlights the spherical nature of the world, or simply a sphere of existence.
*   **Meaning:** Oh, most beautiful being moving upon this earthly sphere, or in this mortal world,

---

### Line 3: Would thou wert as I am, and I a man,
*   **"Would thou wert"**: An archaic expression meaning "I wish you were" or "If only you were."
*   **"as I am"**: Venus is an immortal goddess, consumed by passionate sexual desire. She wishes Adonis possessed her intense passion and amorous nature.
*   **"and I a man"**: Venus, in her frustration, wishes she were a man. This reversal of roles suggests she wants to be the pursuer in a more aggressive, traditionally masculine way, or perhaps she believes that as a man, she could better understand or appeal to Adonis's masculine nature, which is currently resistant to her advances.
*   **Meaning:** I wish you were as passionate and desiring as I am, and I wish I were a man (like you).

---

### Line 4: My heart all whole as thine, thy heart my wound;
*   **"My heart all whole as thine"**: Venus expresses a desire for her heart to be untouched, unburdened by love, and resilient, similar to Adonis's heart, which is currently unaffected and "whole" (unwounded by desire or rejection). "Whole" here means complete, undamaged, and free from emotional pain or vulnerability.
*   **"thy heart my wound"**: She wishes that Adonis's heart ‚Äì his emotional coldness, his indifference, or his rejection of her love ‚Äì were the source of her pain and suffering. The "wound" is a metaphor for the deep agony of unrequited love that she feels. The phrase presents a paradox: his "wholeness" is her "wound."
*   **Meaning:** I wish my heart were completely undamaged and free from love's pain, as yours is, and that your indifferent heart were the cause of my deep suffering.

---

### Line 5: For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee,
*   **"For one sweet look"**: In exchange for even a single kind, affectionate, or encouraging glance from Adonis. "Sweet" implies tenderness and receptiveness, which he currently lacks.
*   **"thy help I would assure thee"**: Venus promises Adonis her assistance or aid, leveraging her divine power. "Assure" means to guarantee or promise with certainty. This is a clear attempt to bargain or bribe him for his affection.
*   **Meaning:** For just one loving glance from you, I would guarantee you my divine assistance.

---

### Line 6: Though nothing but my body‚Äôs bane would cure thee.‚Äô
*   **"my body‚Äôs bane"**: "Bane" means something that causes ruin, distress, or poison. Here, Venus ironically refers to her own physical presence and her overwhelming sexual desire as a "bane" from Adonis's perspective, because he resists it as if it were harmful or destructive to his chaste nature. Yet, she frames it as the necessary 'medicine.' Shakespeare uses this paradox to highlight the clash between her amorous nature and his aversion.
*   **"would cure thee"**: To heal him, or to bring him into a state of sexual maturity and experience (from Venus's perspective). This suggests her belief that his current resistance to love is a sort of ailment that only her physical love can remedy.
*   **Meaning:** Even though the only thing that would "cure" you (or fulfill my desire) is the overwhelming, perhaps destructive (to your chastity), power of my physical love, which you resist.

| Metaphor        | "the engine of her thoughts"                      | Compares Venus's mind to a machine, emphasizing the powerful, systematic, and persistent nature of her intellectual activity and her determination to persuade Adonis.                                                                                               |
| Apostrophe      | "O fairest mover on this mortal round"            | Direct address to Adonis, who is present but unresponsive. It heightens the dramatic intensity of Venus's plea and underscores her desperate attempts to engage with him.                                                                                             |
| Paradox / Irony | "My heart all whole as thine, thy heart my wound" | Reveals the contradictory nature of Venus's emotional state. She wishes for a "whole" heart like Adonis's but simultaneously acknowledges his "whole" (unwounded) heart is the cause of her pain. Also "body's bane would cure thee" presents something harmful as a remedy. |
| Hyperbole       | "nothing but my body‚Äôs bane would cure thee"      | Exaggerates the effect of her physical being on Adonis, portraying her love as a powerful, almost destructive force that is paradoxically presented as the only "cure" for his resistance. It emphasizes her overwhelming desire and perceived power. |
| Chiasmus (loose)| "Would thou wert as I am, and I a man"            | While not a perfect AB-BA, this structure reverses the desired states for Venus and Adonis, creating a sense of balanced inversion. It highlights her profound wish for a reversal of roles and natures to bridge the gap between them.                        |

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza marks a pivotal moment in Venus's relentless pursuit of Adonis. Having failed with direct physical enticement, she now shifts to intellectual and emotional manipulation, revealing her deep frustration and the intensity of her unrequited passion. She expresses a profound wish for a complete reversal of their natures and roles: she longs for Adonis to be as ardently passionate as she is, and for herself to be a man, perhaps believing that a masculine approach would better succeed with him. This highlights the overwhelming and even desperate nature of her desire, leading her to contemplate transcending her own divine femininity to achieve her aim.

The stanza vividly portrays the pain of her "wound" of unrequited love, contrasted sharply with Adonis's "whole" (unaffected) heart. The final lines reveal her warped, almost transactional, logic: she offers her divine help for a mere glance, yet then asserts that only her overwhelming physical love ‚Äì which she ironically labels as "bane" (a destructive force from his perspective) ‚Äì can "cure" him. This suggests that she views his youthful chastity and aversion to love as a sickness she must remedy, further emphasizing the possessive and dominant aspects of her love. This entire speech underscores the central conflict of the poem: the clash between Venus's powerful, procreative, and often aggressive love, and Adonis's innocent, death-obsessed, and love-rejecting nature. Her inability to accept his rejection fuels her increasingly desperate and manipulative attempts to win him over.
