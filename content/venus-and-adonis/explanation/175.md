## üìñ Original Stanza
```
Whereat each tributary subject quakes;
As when the wind, imprison‚Äôd in the ground,
Struggling for passage, earth‚Äôs foundation shakes,
Which with cold terror doth men‚Äôs minds confound.
This mutiny each part doth so surprise   
That from their dark beds once more leap her eyes;

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: "Whereat each tributary subject quakes;"
*   **"Whereat"**: As a result of which; at which point. It connects this physical reaction to the preceding emotional turmoil or internal state (not explicitly stated in this stanza but implied by the context of Venus's struggle).
*   **"each tributary subject"**: A metaphor where the different parts of Venus's body or perhaps her faculties (will, reason, etc.) are depicted as subordinate "subjects" to a dominant, overwhelming emotion. "Tributary" suggests they are forced to yield or pay homage to this power. Shakespeare chooses this to emphasize the complete and involuntary nature of her body's response to her intense feelings.
*   **"quakes"**: Trembles violently, shakes uncontrollably, shudders. It suggests a profound and unsettling physical reaction, similar to an earthquake.
*   **Meaning:** As a result of this intense internal state, every part of her being trembles and shakes uncontrollably.

### Line 2: "As when the wind, imprison‚Äôd in the ground,"
*   **"As when"**: This introduces a vivid simile, comparing Venus's internal turmoil to a natural phenomenon.
*   **"the wind, imprison‚Äôd in the ground"**: This refers to an ancient and widely held belief that earthquakes were caused by strong winds or vapours trapped beneath the earth's surface, struggling to escape. Shakespeare uses this scientific understanding of his time to create a powerful image of internal pressure.
*   **Meaning:** Just like when the wind, trapped deep within the earth,

---

### Line 3: "Struggling for passage, earth‚Äôs foundation shakes,"
*   **"Struggling for passage"**: The trapped "wind" (representing the powerful, unrestrained emotion within Venus) is depicted as actively trying to find a way out, exerting immense pressure. This personifies the wind, giving it agency.
*   **"earth‚Äôs foundation shakes"**: The very core structure of the earth trembles violently. This provides a direct parallel to the internal "shaking" or disruption within Venus, suggesting that her emotions are so powerful they shake her very essence.
*   **Meaning:** Struggles to find a way out, causing the very foundation of the earth to shake violently,

---

### Line 4: "Which with cold terror doth men‚Äôs minds confound."
*   **"Which"**: Refers to the shaking of the earth's foundation.
*   **"cold terror"**: A chilling, paralyzing, and deeply unsettling fear. "Cold" emphasizes the visceral, almost physical sensation of dread.
*   **"doth men‚Äôs minds confound"**: Utterly bewilders, confuses, or overwhelms people's minds, stripping them of reason or composure. This highlights the overwhelming and disorienting effect of such a powerful force, linking it back to Venus's own state of emotional disarray.
*   **Meaning:** And this shaking fills people's minds with a chilling terror that utterly bewilders and disorients them.

---

### Line 5: "This mutiny each part doth so surprise"
*   **"This mutiny"**: A rebellion or revolt, a violent uprising against authority or control. Here, it refers to the overwhelming, disruptive surge of emotion within Venus, likened to an internal rebellion that her own will cannot suppress. Shakespeare chooses this word to emphasize the uncontrollable and almost violent nature of her passion.
*   **"each part"**: Refers to every aspect of Venus's being, both physical and emotional, reinforcing the idea that her entire self is affected.
*   **"doth so surprise"**: So overwhelms, so intensely affects, or so forcibly takes control of. "Surprise" here implies a sudden and powerful takeover rather than mere astonishment.
*   **Meaning:** This internal rebellion of emotion so profoundly overwhelms every part of her being

---

### Line 6: "That from their dark beds once more leap her eyes;"
*   **"That from their dark beds"**: Refers to her eyes being set in their sockets, which are like "beds." "Dark" could imply they were closed, downcast, or obscured in a moment of despair or reflection, only to open suddenly.
*   **"once more leap her eyes"**: Her eyes, previously perhaps closed or downcast, suddenly open wide and fix intently, as if jumping or springing forth from their sockets due to the intensity of her emotion. "Leap" suggests a sudden, forceful, and almost desperate movement, mirroring the "quakes" and "mutiny." This is a physical manifestation of her renewed, intense focus and desire.
*   **Meaning:** That her eyes, as if jumping from their dark sockets (or opening wide from being closed), suddenly dart out again with renewed intensity.

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza vividly portrays Venus's profound and overwhelming emotional state, primarily her intense and unrequited desire for Adonis. Following moments of despair or resignation, this stanza describes a re-ignition of her passion, so powerful it manifests as a full-body tremor. The extended simile of an earthquake (lines 2-4) is central to its meaning, likening her internal turmoil to a natural catastrophe caused by an "imprison'd wind." This powerfully communicates the uncontrollable, disruptive, and almost violent nature of her feelings, which "confound" reason and "surprise" every part of her being like a "mutiny."

The significance lies in how this physical and emotional upheaval drives Venus's actions. The "leaping" of her eyes in the final line signifies a renewed, almost desperate focus on Adonis. Despite his continued rejection and her moments of despair, her passion is too fundamental to be suppressed. It is an instinctual force, shaking her to her core, similar to how an earthquake shakes the earth's foundations. This highlights a key theme of the poem: the destructive and overpowering nature of uncontrolled passion, particularly when it is unreciprocated. Venus's desire is not merely romantic longing; it is a primal, almost geological force that dictates her very being, compelling her to pursue Adonis despite the futility and humiliation, thus underscoring the tragic imbalance of their relationship. The stanza emphasizes Venus's lack of agency over her own emotions, portraying her as a victim of her own powerful affections.
