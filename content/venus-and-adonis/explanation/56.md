*Shakespeare's Venus and Adonis*

## üìñ Original Stanza
```
An oven that is stopp‚Äôd, or river stay‚Äôd,
Burneth more hotly, swelleth with more rage:        
So of concealed sorrow may be said;
Free vent of words love‚Äôs fire doth assuage;
But when the heart‚Äôs attorney once is mute
The client breaks, as desperate in his suit.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: "An oven that is stopp‚Äôd, or river stay‚Äôd,"
*   **"stopp‚Äôd"**: In this context, "stopp'd" means sealed or blocked, referring to an oven where the vent or flue is closed, preventing the escape of heat or smoke. This action would cause the heat within to intensify.
*   **"river stay‚Äôd"**: This refers to a river whose natural flow is obstructed or dammed, causing the water to accumulate and its pressure to build up behind the barrier.
*   **Meaning:** An oven that is sealed, or a river whose flow is halted,

---

### Line 2: "Burneth more hotly, swelleth with more rage:"
*   **"Burneth more hotly"**: Because the heat from the oven is contained and cannot dissipate, it becomes more intense and concentrated.
*   **"swelleth with more rage"**: The river, blocked from its natural course, builds up greater force and destructive potential due to the increased pressure of the contained water. "Rage" here signifies a powerful, almost violent, intensity.
*   **Meaning:** burns with greater heat, and swells with a more forceful intensity:

---

### Line 3: "So of concealed sorrow may be said;"
*   **"concealed sorrow"**: This refers to grief, pain, or deep emotional distress that is hidden, suppressed, or kept secret rather than expressed openly.
*   **"may be said"**: This phrase explicitly connects the preceding physical analogies (the oven and river) to the human emotional experience, stating that the same principle applies.
*   **Meaning:** The same principle applies to sorrow or emotional pain that is kept hidden;

---

### Line 4: "Free vent of words love‚Äôs fire doth assuage;"
*   **"Free vent of words"**: This refers to the unrestrained and open expression of one's feelings, thoughts, and emotions through speech. "Vent" implies an outlet or release.
*   **"love‚Äôs fire"**: A metaphor for the intense passion, pain, or internal turmoil caused by love, particularly when it is overwhelming, unrequited, or distressful. It's the "heat" or "rage" of the emotional state.
*   **"doth assuage"**: "Doth" is an archaic form of "does." "Assuage" means to make less intense, soothe, calm, or relieve. The act of speaking openly helps to lessen the severity of emotional distress.
*   **Meaning:** Because the open expression of feelings through words helps to calm the intense emotions associated with love;

---

### Line 5: "But when the heart‚Äôs attorney once is mute"
*   **"heart‚Äôs attorney"**: A powerful personification and metaphor. The "attorney" represents the faculty of speech or the ability to articulate one's emotions and desires, acting as an advocate or spokesperson for the "heart" (the seat of one's feelings and inner being).
*   **"once is mute"**: When this advocate, the ability to speak and express, becomes silent or is suppressed. It implies that the emotional "case" of the heart has no one to argue its cause.
*   **Meaning:** But when the voice that represents the heart's feelings is silenced,

---

### Line 6: "The client breaks, as desperate in his suit."
*   **"The client"**: Continuing the legal metaphor, "the client" refers to the person experiencing the emotion, or the "heart" itself, which is dependent on its "attorney" (speech) to represent its "suit."
*   **"breaks"**: Implies a collapse, a giving way, or being overwhelmed. It suggests a complete emotional or psychological breakdown.
*   **"desperate in his suit"**: Having lost all hope in their plea or petition. The "suit" is the emotional struggle or internal appeal that the "attorney" (speech) was meant to present. Without expression, the "case" is lost, leaving the individual in despair.
*   **Meaning:** The individual (the "client" of the heart) collapses, as if utterly hopeless in their emotional struggle or plea.

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza profoundly explores the psychological impact of emotional suppression, positing that unspoken sorrow or passion becomes dangerously intensified, much like a blocked oven or dammed river. It introduces the vital concept that "free vent of words" ‚Äì open communication ‚Äì is essential to "assuage" the "love's fire" or emotional pain within. The powerful, extended legal metaphor of the "heart's attorney" and "client" illustrates that the ability to articulate one's feelings acts as a crucial advocate for one's inner well-being. When this "attorney" (speech) is "mute," the "client" (the individual or their heart) suffers a breakdown, becoming "desperate in his suit," or utterly hopeless in their internal struggle.

In the context of *Venus and Adonis*, this stanza offers a crucial insight into the characters' emotional dynamics. Venus, consumed by her overwhelming desire for Adonis, continuously expresses her passion through elaborate speeches, pleas, and arguments. While her efforts to win Adonis's affection are futile, this stanza suggests that her abundant verbal output, despite its external failure, might internally "assuage" some of the intensity of her "love's fire," preventing her from completely "breaking." Conversely, Adonis is characterized by his reticence and discomfort with Venus's amorous advances, often responding with silence or curt rejections. His aversion to love and his preoccupation with the hunt (which symbolizes death) are deeply ingrained and largely unexpressed verbally. The stanza implies that Adonis's suppression of his true feelings and fears leaves him vulnerable to the kind of internal collapse described, making him emotionally brittle and ultimately leading to his tragic end. This stanza thus underscores one of the poem's central themes: the destructive nature of unrequited passion and, more broadly, the inherent dangers of emotional suppression versus the therapeutic, albeit not always effective, power of expression.
