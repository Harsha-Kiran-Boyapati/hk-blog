## üìñ Original Stanza
```
Forc‚Äôd to content, but never to obey,
Panting he lies, and breatheth in her face;
She feedeth on the steam, as on a prey,
And calls it heavenly moisture, air of grace;        
Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers
So they were dewd with such distilling showers.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: Forc‚Äôd to content, but never to obey,
*   **"Forc‚Äôd to content"**: Adonis is compelled to be present or to endure the situation, indicating his physical presence is due to Venus's overwhelming force rather than his own will. "Content" here means to be held or to be satisfied in place, highlighting his unwilling resignation to his physical predicament. Shakespeare chooses "content" to show his external compliance but internal resistance.
*   **"but never to obey"**: This emphasizes Adonis's steadfast internal refusal to submit to Venus's desires or will. He may be physically restrained, but his spirit and intentions remain defiant and independent.
*   **Meaning:** He is forced to endure the situation, but he never willingly submits to her desires.

---

### Line 2: Panting he lies, and breatheth in her face;
*   **"Panting he lies"**: Adonis is exhausted and breathless, likely from his struggle against Venus or from the general distress of the situation. "Panting" conveys physical exertion and discomfort, not passion or desire. It underscores his vulnerability and physical surrender due to fatigue.
*   **"and breatheth in her face"**: This describes their close physical proximity. While intimate, in this context it's a consequence of his being held down and his physical state, rather than an act of affection. For Venus, it's a desired closeness, but for Adonis, it's merely a physical happenstance.
*   **Meaning:** Exhausted and short of breath, he lies there, his breath coming out directly onto her face.

---

### Line 3: She feedeth on the steam, as on a prey,
*   **"She feedeth on the steam"**: "Steam" refers to Adonis's warm breath, which Venus metaphorically "consumes." This portrays her as drawing sustenance or pleasure from his very essence, even his discomfort.
*   **"as on a prey"**: This powerful simile explicitly likens Venus's actions to a predator consuming its victim. It highlights her aggressive, consuming desire and Adonis's position as her unwilling target. Shakespeare's choice of "prey" starkly defines the power dynamic and the predatory nature of her pursuit.
*   **Meaning:** She consumes his breath as eagerly and voraciously as a predator devours its hunted victim.

---

### Line 4: And calls it heavenly moisture, air of grace;
*   **"calls it heavenly moisture"**: Venus romanticizes and elevates Adonis's breath, perceiving it as something divine, pure, and life-giving, rather than just exhalation. This reveals her highly subjective, idealized, and almost worshipful perception of him and her own intense desire.
*   **"air of grace"**: Similar to "heavenly moisture," she attributes spiritual and divine qualities to his breath. "Grace" suggests divine favor, beauty, or spiritual purity. This further emphasizes her romanticization and idolization, disregarding Adonis's actual feelings or distress. Shakespeare uses these terms to highlight Venus's self-delusion and the depth of her passion.
*   **Meaning:** And she describes his breath as divine dew and air imbued with spiritual blessing.

---

### Line 5: Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers
*   **"Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers"**: This is a vivid metaphor. Venus desires her own face, specifically her cheeks, to be as fertile, beautiful, and receptive as a blooming garden. The "flowers" represent her own blossoming beauty and fertility, ready to be nurtured.
*   **Meaning:** She wishes her cheeks were like gardens overflowing with beautiful blossoms.

---

### Line 6: So they were dewd with such distilling showers.
*   **"So they were dewd"**: "Dewd" (dewed) means moistened or refreshed as if by dew. She wishes her cheeks, imagined as gardens, could be moistened by his breath.
*   **"with such distilling showers"**: "Distilling" implies a gentle, fine falling or dripping, like dew or light rain. "Showers" refers to Adonis's breath, imagined as nurturing moisture. This extends the garden metaphor, portraying Adonis's breath as the life-giving element that would make her "garden" (her beauty and fertility) flourish. It underscores her intense physical longing and desire to absorb his essence.
*   **Meaning:** So that her face could be moistened and nourished by such gently falling, permeating showers of breath.

| **Hyperbole**        | "calls it heavenly moisture, air of grace"                 | Venus exaggerates the quality of Adonis's breath, elevating it to a divine status. This underscores her intense, almost worshipful obsession and her romanticized, self-delusional perception, ignoring his actual distress.                                      |
| **Imagery**          | "Panting he lies," "breatheth in her face," "gardens full of flowers," "distilling showers" | Creates vivid sensory pictures of Adonis's exhaustion and physical state, Venus's predatory intimacy, and her idealized vision of beauty and nourishment. It engages the reader's senses and enhances the emotional impact.                                |
| **Juxtaposition/Contrast** | "Forc‚Äôd to content, but never to obey" vs. "calls it heavenly moisture, air of grace" | Highlights the stark contrast between Adonis's involuntary physical presence and internal resistance, and Venus's romanticized, almost beatific interpretation of the encounter. This underscores the profound disconnect between their experiences and desires. |

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza is pivotal in establishing the central conflict and power dynamic of Venus and Adonis. It vividly portrays Adonis as a victim of Venus's overwhelming and unrequited passion. His "panting" and forced "content" highlight his physical exhaustion and unwilling submission, contrasting sharply with Venus's predatory consumption of his breath "as on a prey." Her romanticization of his exhalations as "heavenly moisture" and "air of grace" reveals her intense, self-delusional desire and her complete disregard for Adonis's distress.

The extended metaphor of her cheeks as "gardens full of flowers" to be "dewd with such distilling showers" (his breath) underscores Venus's longing for fertility, beauty, and physical union. This stanza reinforces the poem's broader themes of **unrequited love**, **the predatory nature of desire**, and the **vulnerability of youthful innocence** against forceful passion. It sets up the dynamic where Venus embodies the relentless, consuming aspect of lust, while Adonis represents a youthful, resistant purity. This conflict drives the narrative, leading to the tragic consequences that unfold, as Venus's intense and possessive love ultimately fails to win Adonis's affection and contributes to his tragic fate.
