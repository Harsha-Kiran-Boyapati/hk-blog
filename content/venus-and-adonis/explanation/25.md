‚ÄòBid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear,
Or like a fairy, trip upon the green,
Or, like a nymph, with long dishevell‚Äôd hair,
Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen:        
Love is a spirit all compact of fire,
Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: ‚ÄòBid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear,
*   **"Bid me discourse"**: Command or ask me to speak at length, to tell a story, or to engage in conversation. "Discourse" here means to speak or converse formally or extensively on a subject. Shakespeare uses "bid" to show Venus's eagerness to please and her confidence in her oratorical powers.
*   **"I will enchant thine ear"**: I will captivate, charm, or mesmerize your sense of hearing. "Enchant" suggests a magical or irresistible power. "Thine" is an archaic possessive pronoun, meaning "your." Venus is boasting about her ability to utterly charm Adonis with her words.
*   **Meaning:** "Command me to speak at length, and I promise that I will completely charm and captivate your hearing."

### Line 2: Or like a fairy, trip upon the green,
*   **"Or like a fairy"**: This introduces an alternative action, comparing Venus's movement to that of a fairy. Fairies are typically depicted as light, ethereal, magical, and graceful beings, suggesting an otherworldly quality.
*   **"trip upon the green"**: To dance lightly and quickly, or skip gracefully, on the grassy common ground or meadow. "Trip" here means to step lightly and nimbly, often in a dance. "Green" refers to a grassy area, usually a meadow or common. Shakespeare uses "trip" to convey a sense of effortless, almost gravity-defying movement.
*   **Meaning:** "Or, alternatively, I can dance lightly and gracefully like a fairy on the grassy fields."

---

### Line 3: Or, like a nymph, with long dishevell‚Äôd hair,
*   **"Or, like a nymph"**: This presents another alternative, comparing Venus to a nymph. Nymphs are mythological spirits of nature, typically beautiful, young, and often associated with wildness, freedom, and sensuality. The comparison elevates Venus's beauty and connection to nature.
*   **"with long dishevell‚Äôd hair"**: With long, untidy, or flowing hair. "Dishevell‚Äôd" implies a natural, wild, and unconstrained look, contrasting with formal or restrained hairstyles. This detail suggests a state of abandon, freedom, and passion, suitable for wild, uninhibited dancing and appealing to a primal sense of beauty.
*   **Meaning:** "Or, I can be like a nature spirit, with my long hair flowing freely and untamed."

---

### Line 4: Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen:
*   **"Dance on the sands"**: To perform a dance on a sandy surface, such as a beach or riverbank. This sets a scene for her graceful movement.
*   **"and yet no footing seen"**: Despite dancing, no footprints or marks are left behind. This emphasizes extreme lightness, ethereal quality, and a magical ability to leave no trace. It reinforces the fairy/nymph imagery, suggesting a supernatural grace and agility that transcends ordinary human movement.
*   **Meaning:** "I can dance on the sandy ground in such a way that no footprints or marks are visible, as if I am too light to leave a trace."

---

### Line 5: Love is a spirit all compact of fire,
*   **"Love is a spirit"**: Love is presented not as a mere physical sensation or emotion, but as an essence, an ethereal, non-physical being or powerful force. "Spirit" suggests something intangible yet potent.
*   **"all compact of fire"**: Entirely composed of fire. "Compact of" means made up or consisting wholly of. Fire symbolizes intense passion, energy, burning desire, warmth, and vitality. Here, it emphasizes the intense, active, and consuming nature of the love Venus advocates for. Shakespeare uses "fire" to highlight the transformative and powerful aspect of love.
*   **Meaning:** "Love is an essence or force entirely made up of intense, burning passion."

---

### Line 6: Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire.
*   **"Not gross to sink"**: It is not heavy, coarse, or material enough to be weighed down or to descend. "Gross" here means bulky, crude, or lacking refinement, often implying a base or carnal nature. "Sink" implies being dragged down, perhaps by earthly desires or physicality. Shakespeare uses "gross" to contrast with a higher form of love.
*   **"but light, and will aspire"**: Instead, it is ethereal and will rise upwards, aim for higher things, or be actively energetic. "Aspire" means to rise high, soar, or aim for noble goals. This directly contrasts with the idea of being weighed down by 'gross' desires, suggesting an elevated, active, and upward-striving form of love, moving beyond mere physical lust.
*   **Meaning:** "Love is not heavy or crude enough to be weighed down; instead, it is light and strives to rise or reach for higher things."

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza is a pivotal moment where Venus, in her relentless pursuit of Adonis, employs a dual strategy of enticement: first, by showcasing her irresistible charm and graceful physical presence, and second, by articulating her elevated philosophy of love.

The first four lines are Venus's direct attempts to woo Adonis through an array of captivating performances. She offers herself as a masterful orator ("enchant thine ear"), a light-footed dancer of ethereal grace ("like a fairy, trip upon the green," "no footing seen"), and a wild, uninhibited spirit of natural beauty ("like a nymph, with long dishevell‚Äôd hair"). This progression from verbal to physical allure, imbued with supernatural comparisons, aims to overwhelm Adonis with her divine and multifaceted appeal. The imagery of leaving "no footing seen" underscores her almost unearthly perfection and the overwhelming nature of her presence.

The final two lines mark a significant shift from personal appeal to a profound, philosophical declaration about the nature of love itself. Venus defines love as "a spirit all compact of fire," emphasizing its intrinsic intensity, energy, and burning passion. Crucially, she asserts that this love is "Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire." This is a direct counter-argument to any perception of love as base, carnal, or physically debasing. For Venus, true love is not heavy or crude; it is an elevating, active, and upward-striving force, reaching for higher, more refined states.

In the broader context of the poem, this stanza is central to understanding the thematic conflict between Venus's ardent, active desire and Adonis's cold, youthful chastity. Venus presents love as a beautiful, powerful, and spiritual force, attempting to elevate her pursuit beyond mere lust. She seeks to persuade Adonis that her passion is not base but a noble, invigorating expression of a higher love that naturally seeks to ascend and ignite. This contrasts sharply with Adonis's later explicit rejection of Venus's "love" as a form of "lust" that detracts from his true passion for hunting and purity. The stanza thus sets up the fundamental differing views on love that drive the narrative's tension, showcasing Venus's perspective as one of passionate, aspiring devotion, while highlighting the tragic imbalance of desire between the two characters.
