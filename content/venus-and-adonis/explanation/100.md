```
Now is she in the very lists of love,
Her champion mounted for the hot encounter:
All is imaginary she doth prove,
He will not manage her, although he mount her;
That worse than Tantalus‚Äô is her annoy,
To clip Elysium and to lack her joy.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: "Now is she in the very lists of love,"
*   **"Now is she in"**: At this moment, Venus finds herself in the position of being.
*   **"the very lists of love"**: The tournament grounds or arena of love. "Lists" refers to the enclosed area where medieval tournaments took place. Venus is in the arena where love's battles are fought.
*   **Meaning:** "Now she finds herself in love's tournament arena,"

---

### Line 2: "Her champion mounted for the hot encounter:"
*   **"Her champion"**: Adonis is described as her knight or warrior who will fight for her in love's tournament.
*   **"mounted"**: On horseback, ready for battle. This continues the tournament metaphor while also carrying sexual connotations.
*   **"for the hot encounter"**: Prepared for the passionate, intense battle/sexual encounter. "Hot" suggests both the heat of battle and sexual passion.
*   **Meaning:** "Her knight is on horseback, ready for the passionate encounter:"

### Line 3: "All is imaginary she doth prove,"
*   **"All is imaginary"**: Everything turns out to be fantasy, illusion, or wishful thinking rather than reality.
*   **"she doth prove"**: She discovers, she finds out through experience. Venus learns this through disappointment.
*   **Meaning:** "She discovers that everything is just her imagination,"

---

### Line 4: "He will not manage her, although he mount her;"
*   **"He will not manage her"**: He will not control, handle, or have sexual relations with her. "Manage" in riding terms means to control a horse, but here carries sexual implications.
*   **"although he mount her"**: Even though he is positioned on top of her physically. "Mount" continues the horse metaphor while being sexually explicit.
*   **Meaning:** "He won't take control of her sexually, even though he's physically on top of her;"

---

### Line 5: "That worse than Tantalus‚Äô is her annoy,"
*   **"worse than Tantalus'"**: More torturous than the punishment of Tantalus, who in Greek mythology was condemned to eternal hunger and thirst with food and water always just out of reach.
*   **"is her annoy"**: Is her frustration, torment, or vexation. "Annoy" here means serious distress rather than mild irritation.
*   **Meaning:** "Her frustration is worse than Tantalus's torture,"

---

### Line 6: "To clip Elysium and to lack her joy."
*   **"To clip Elysium"**: To embrace or hold paradise. "Clip" means to embrace or encircle with arms. Elysium was the paradise for heroes in Greek mythology.
*   **"and to lack her joy"**: But to be denied her pleasure or satisfaction. Despite having paradise within her grasp, she cannot enjoy it.
*   **Meaning:** "To hold paradise in her arms but be denied her happiness."

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza represents the climax of Venus's physical pursuit and the moment of her ultimate frustration. Despite achieving physical intimacy with Adonis, she discovers that physical proximity without emotional consent is meaningless and torturous.

**The Tournament of Love**: The medieval tournament metaphor elevates this encounter to a formal, chivalric context. Venus sees herself as having finally reached the arena where love's battles are decided, with Adonis as her champion ready to fight for her.

**Reality vs. Fantasy**: The devastating line "All is imaginary she doth prove" reveals that Venus's entire seductive campaign has been based on fantasy. Her interpretation of Adonis's actions and responses has been wishful thinking rather than reality.

**Physical vs. Emotional Intimacy**: The contrast between being "mounted" but not "managed" captures the essential emptiness of physical contact without mutual desire. Venus learns that forced intimacy provides no satisfaction.

**Mythological Torment**: The comparison to Tantalus is particularly apt‚ÄîVenus can see, touch, and hold what she desires, but cannot truly possess or enjoy it. This makes her suffering worse than simple deprivation.

**Paradise Lost**: "To clip Elysium and to lack her joy" perfectly captures Venus's situation‚Äîshe has achieved what should be perfect happiness (physical union with Adonis) but finds it completely unsatisfying without his willing participation.

**The Failure of Force**: This stanza represents the complete failure of Venus's aggressive seduction strategy. All her rhetoric, persistence, and even physical dominance cannot create the mutual desire necessary for true fulfillment.

**Gender Role Reversal**: Venus is positioned as the one seeking satisfaction while Adonis remains passive, reversing traditional gender expectations about sexual desire and initiative.

**The Nature of Consent**: Shakespeare explores the concept that physical compliance is meaningless without emotional engagement‚Äîa sophisticated understanding of consent for his era.

**Climactic Irony**: This moment should be Venus's triumph, but instead becomes her greatest defeat. The achievement of her goal reveals the goal's worthlessness without Adonis's genuine participation.

This stanza serves as the poem's central revelation about the nature of love and desire‚Äîthat they cannot be forced, conquered, or won through persistence alone, but require mutual feeling to have any meaning.
