Till, cheering up her senses sore dismay‚Äôd,

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: "Thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy,"
*   **"Thus stands she"**: Refers to Venus's physical posture and emotional state following her intense premonition of Adonis's death. "Thus" indicates the resulting posture from her prior emotional turmoil.
*   **"trembling ecstasy"**: This is an oxymoron. "Trembling" denotes physical shaking due to fear, agitation, or extreme emotion. "Ecstasy" here refers to a state of being overwhelmed by intense emotion, a trance-like state where one is "beside oneself" or dispossessed of normal self-control due to powerful feelings, not necessarily positive rapture. Shakespeare uses this paradox to convey Venus's profound, contradictory emotional distress, combining fear with an overwhelming sensation.
*   **Meaning:** "This is how she stands, in a state of intense emotional upheaval, physically trembling and utterly overwhelmed."

---

### Line 2: "Till, cheering up her senses sore dismay‚Äôd,"
*   **"cheering up"**: To encourage, revive, or restore to a state of hope or composure. Venus is actively attempting to regain mental control.
*   **"her senses"**: Refers to her faculties of perception, her mind, her ability to reason and feel.
*   **"sore dismay‚Äôd"**: "Sore" means greatly or intensely. "Dismay‚Äôd" means filled with distress, consternation, or anxiety; disheartened. Her mental faculties were severely disturbed and disheartened by the premonition. Shakespeare emphasizes the deep impact of her inner conflict.
*   **Meaning:** "Until she began to encourage and restore her mental faculties, which were greatly distressed and disheartened,"

---

### Line 3: "She tells them ‚Äòtis a causeless fantasy,"
*   **"tells them"**: Refers to her senses, as if addressing them directly or rationalizing to herself.
*   **"‚Äòtis"**: A contraction of "it is".
*   **"causeless fantasy"**: A baseless or groundless illusion or delusion. "Fantasy" here means an unfounded idea or mental image, not necessarily a pleasant one. She attempts to dismiss her premonition as something without real cause or substance, highlighting her denial. Shakespeare shows her desperate attempt to use reason against her powerful intuition.
*   **Meaning:** "She tells her senses (or herself) that it is merely an illusion or delusion without any real basis,"

---

### Line 4: "And childish error, that they are afraid;"
*   **"childish error"**: An immature or foolish mistake. By categorizing her fear as such, she attempts to diminish its power and significance, revealing her struggle to assert control over her emotions.
*   **"that they are afraid"**: Refers to her senses or her inner self being fearful. This reinforces the idea that she is trying to talk herself out of the fear.
*   **Meaning:** "And a foolish, immature mistake that her senses (or she herself) are afraid;"

---

### Line 5: "Bids them leave quaking, bids them fear no more:"
*   **"Bids them"**: Commands or instructs her senses/fears.
*   **"leave quaking"**: To stop trembling or shaking, often from fear or cold. "Quaking" emphasizes the physical manifestation of her fear.
*   **"fear no more"**: A direct command to cease being afraid. The repetition of "bids them" emphasizes her desperate, almost frantic, attempt at self-reassurance and control.
*   **Meaning:** "She commands her senses to stop trembling, and commands them to no longer be afraid:"

---

### Line 6: "And with that word she spied the hunted boar;"
*   **"And with that word"**: Immediately after she finishes speaking these words of self-reassurance and denial. This creates a powerful, stark, and ironic juxtaposition.
*   **"spied"**: Caught sight of, observed, or detected.
*   **"the hunted boar"**: The object of the hunt, and tragically, the very creature responsible for Adonis's fate. This marks the culmination of her premonition and her denial. Shakespeare uses this swift turn to underscore the futility of denial in the face of destiny or reality.
*   **Meaning:** "And at that precise moment, she caught sight of the wild boar that was being hunted;"

| **Oxymoron**     | "trembling ecstasy" (Line 1)                                         | Juxtaposes the physical manifestation of fear/agitation ("trembling") with an overwhelming, trance-like emotional state ("ecstasy"). This highlights Venus's paradoxical and extreme emotional turmoil, indicating she is deeply disturbed and beyond normal self-possession.                                                                                                                             |
| **Personification**| "cheering up her senses sore dismay‚Äôd" (Line 2), "She tells them ‚Äòtis a causeless fantasy" (Line 3), "Bids them leave quaking, bids them fear no more" (Line 5) | Venus treats her own senses as separate entities she can command and rationalize with. This emphasizes her intense internal struggle, her attempt to control her irrational fears, and the disjunction between her intuitive fears and her rational denial.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Dramatic Irony** | Venus's attempts to dismiss her fears as "causeless fantasy" and "childish error" (Lines 3-4), immediately followed by the appearance of the boar (Line 6). | The audience, either knowing the myth or anticipating tragedy from earlier foreshadowing in the poem, is aware that Venus's fears are tragically well-founded. Her self-deception and rationalization make the sudden appearance of the boar even more poignant and devastating, highlighting the futility of her efforts.                                                                         |
| **Juxtaposition**| The shift from Venus's self-reassurance and denial to the sudden, concrete appearance of the boar (Lines 5-6). | The abrupt transition from psychological struggle and denial to the stark reality of the danger creates a powerful dramatic effect. It heightens the tragic irony and underscores the sudden, inescapable confrontation with her worst fears, emphasizing the immediate fulfillment of her premonition.                                                                                              |
| **Repetition / Anaphora**| "Bids them leave quaking, bids them fear no more" (Line 5) | The repetition of "bids them" emphasizes Venus's desperate and forceful attempts to assert control over her own emotional and physical reactions. It conveys a sense of urgency and a frantic effort to suppress her deep-seated fear.                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Foreshadowing**| The entire stanza, particularly Venus's premonition and the sudden appearance of the "hunted boar" (Line 6). | The stanza functions as immediate and powerful foreshadowing, as the boar's appearance directly signals the impending tragedy of Adonis's death. It confirms Venus's fears and sets the stage for the climactic confrontation and subsequent lament.                                                                                                                                                         |

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza marks a critical turning point in *Venus and Adonis*, moving from the erotic pursuit and Venus's passionate pleas to the grim reality of impending tragedy. It vividly portrays Venus's profound internal conflict: her powerful, intuitive premonition of danger for Adonis versus her desperate, rational attempt to deny it. Her "trembling ecstasy" encapsulates a state of intense emotional and physical disarray, caught between a visceral fear and an overwhelming sense of doom. The language she employs to dismiss her fears ‚Äì "causeless fantasy" and "childish error" ‚Äì reveals her desperate struggle to maintain composure and rationalize away her deepest anxieties.

The sudden, immediate appearance of "the hunted boar" in the final line is a moment of cruel and potent dramatic irony. At the very instant Venus manages to convince herself (or attempts to convince her senses) that her fears are baseless, the physical manifestation of her terror appears. This highlights the tragic futility of human denial in the face of an unfolding reality or destiny, a recurring theme in tragic literature. It underscores that even a goddess cannot escape or deflect the inevitable.

In the broader context of *Venus and Adonis*, this stanza profoundly contributes to several key themes:

*   **The Power of Premonition vs. Denial:** Venus's intuition about Adonis's danger proves tragically accurate, demonstrating the limitations of rationalization and denial against an impending fate. It suggests that some truths are felt deeply, beyond the realm of reason.
*   **Love and Fear:** Her immense love for Adonis is inextricably linked with an equally profound and ultimately accurate fear for his safety. This shows the vulnerability inherent in deep affection, particularly when the beloved is engaged in risky pursuits.
*   **The Inevitability of Fate/Tragedy:** Despite Venus's divine status and her fervent attempts to control the situation (both through persuasion of Adonis and self-reassurance), the narrative strongly emphasizes an inescapable tragic destiny for Adonis. The boar's sudden, unbidden appearance serves as an immediate and undeniable confirmation of her worst fears, propelling the poem towards its inevitable tragic climax and the subsequent lamentation, setting the stage for Adonis's violent death and Venus's profound grief.
