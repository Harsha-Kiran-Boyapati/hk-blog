## üìñ Original Stanza
```
By this the love-sick queen began to sweat,
For where they lay the shadow had forsook them,     
And Titan, tired in the mid-day heat
With burning eye did hotly overlook them,
Wishing Adonis had his team to guide,
So he were like him and by Venus‚Äô side.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: "By this the love-sick queen began to sweat,"
*   **"By this"**: By this time; at this point in their encounter.
*   **"love-sick queen"**: Refers to Venus, the goddess of love, who is deeply infatuated with Adonis to the point of physical and emotional distress. "Love-sick" emphasizes her intense, overwhelming, and unrequited passion, while "queen" highlights her divine status contrasted with her very human vulnerability. Shakespeare uses this to immediately convey the physical manifestation of her ardent desire.
*   **"began to sweat"**: Indicates a physical reaction to heat, exertion, or intense passion/frustration. This humanizes the goddess, showing her vulnerability and the physical toll of her unfulfilled desire, making her more relatable despite her divine nature.
*   **Meaning:** At this moment, the goddess Venus, overcome by her intense and unrequited love for Adonis, began to perspire.

### Line 2: "For where they lay the shadow had forsook them,"
*   **"For"**: Because. This word introduces the reason for Venus's sweating.
*   **"where they lay"**: Refers to the specific spot where Venus and Adonis were reclining on the ground.
*   **"the shadow had forsook them"**: The shade (from trees or other natural elements) had abandoned or deserted them. "Forsook" suggests a deliberate act, implying that the protective coolness has actively left, exposing them fully to the sun. Shakespeare uses this to explain the immediate cause of the heat and to emphasize their increasing vulnerability.
*   **Meaning:** This was because the shade that had previously covered the spot where they were lying had now moved away, leaving them directly exposed to the sun.

---

### Line 3: "And Titan, tired in the mid-day heat"
*   **"And Titan"**: Titan here refers to the Sun god, typically Helios or Apollo, who drives the sun chariot across the sky. Shakespeare uses the name "Titan" to evoke a sense of immense power and ancient divinity associated with the sun.
*   **"tired in the mid-day heat"**: This is a personification of the sun. Even the powerful sun god is depicted as weary from the intensity of the midday heat, which emphasizes just how extreme and oppressive the heat has become. It suggests that the sun is laboring, making its gaze even more intense.
*   **Meaning:** And the Sun god, though weary himself from the intense heat of midday,

---

### Line 4: "With burning eye did hotly overlook them,"
*   **"With burning eye"**: A metaphor for the sun's intense and fiery gaze. The sun is frequently personified as having an "eye," emphasizing its all-seeing and penetrating quality. "Burning" highlights the scorching heat it emits.
*   **"did hotly overlook them"**: Looked down upon them intensely and directly with a fierce heat. "Hotly" reiterates the extreme temperature, while "overlook" implies a commanding, supervisory gaze from above. Shakespeare portrays the sun not just as a source of heat, but as an active, conscious, and even intrusive observer.
*   **Meaning:** Watched Venus and Adonis with an intense, scorching gaze from above.

---

### Line 5: "Wishing Adonis had his team to guide,"
*   **"Wishing Adonis had his team to guide"**: Titan (the Sun god) wishes Adonis were in his place, driving his chariot across the sky, which is traditionally pulled by a "team" of horses. This is a classical allusion to Helios, the sun god, and his daily journey. The sun's wish introduces a cosmic dimension to the infatuation surrounding Venus.
*   **Meaning:** The Sun god wished that Adonis was the one driving his fiery chariot across the sky,

---

### Line 6: "So he were like him and by Venus‚Äô side."
*   **"So he were like him"**: This means "so that Adonis would be in Titan's place," implying a transference of identity or power. The sun desires for Adonis to possess the sun's power or role, making Adonis a substitute or proxy for the sun itself.
*   **"and by Venus‚Äô side"**: This is the ultimate goal of Titan's wish. The sun god wishes Adonis to take his place *specifically* so that Adonis (and by proxy, the sun god's influence) could then be physically close to Venus. This reveals the sun's own implicit desire for Venus, adding a layer of cosmic envy or rivalry to the situation.
*   **Meaning:** So that Adonis, by taking on the sun god's powerful role, could then be positioned right beside Venus, implying the sun god's own unfulfilled desire for her.

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza marks a significant shift in the poem's atmosphere, moving from a scene of attempted seduction in cool shade to one of oppressive, unyielding heat. Venus's physical discomfort‚Äî"began to sweat"‚Äîis a direct result of the "shadow had forsook them," symbolizing the removal of any protective barrier from the relentless pursuit of desire. The heat is not merely environmental but a powerful metaphor for the escalating intensity of Venus's passion and the growing tension of the moment.

The personification of the sun as "Titan, tired in the mid-day heat / With burning eye did hotly overlook them" is crucial. It imbues the natural world with sentience and desire, mirroring the very human drama unfolding below. The sun, a cosmic entity, is presented as an active, almost voyeuristic observer, its gaze "hotly overlook[ing]" Venus and Adonis.

The most profound element is the sun's "Wishing Adonis had his team to guide, / So he were like him and by Venus‚Äô side." This reveals a cosmic envy. Even the sun god, a figure of immense power, is captivated by Venus's beauty and seems to wish Adonis could take his place, so that, by proxy, the sun itself could be near Venus. This amplifies Venus's allure and desirability, making her the object of universal attraction, not just Adonis's. It deepens the theme of pervasive, almost suffocating desire that permeates the poem, showing that even celestial beings are not immune to its pull.

In the broader context of Venus and Adonis, this stanza reinforces several key themes:
1.  **The overwhelming power of desire:** The heat and the sun's own desire underscore how passion can be an all-consuming force, affecting both mortals and gods, and even the natural world.
2.  **Venus's futility:** Despite her divine status and overwhelming desire, Adonis remains unresponsive. The sun's "wish" for Adonis to be by Venus's side highlights that even cosmic forces cannot directly influence Adonis's will, emphasizing the unrequited nature of Venus's love.
3.  **The oppressive nature of love:** The oppressive heat and the sun's relentless gaze symbolize the suffocating nature of Venus's love for Adonis, which he perceives as overwhelming and unwelcome.
4.  **Nature mirroring emotion:** The external environment, personified and endowed with its own desires, reflects and amplifies the internal emotional drama, creating a vivid, multi-layered portrayal of love and longing.
