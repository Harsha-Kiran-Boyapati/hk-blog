```
Look, how the world‚Äôs poor people are amaz‚Äôd        
At apparitions, signs, and prodigies,
Whereon with fearful eyes they long have gaz‚Äôd,
Infusing them with dreadful prophecies;     
So she at these sad sighs draws up her breath,
And, sighing it again, exclaims on Death.

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza is a pivotal moment in "Venus and Adonis," marking a dramatic shift in tone from the passionate (and often humorous) pursuit of Adonis by Venus to the tragic realization of his impending death. The stanza's overall meaning is to vividly portray Venus's profound, visceral reaction to the sounds of Adonis's dying sighs, likening her shock and dread to the primal fear experienced by superstitious people confronted with terrifying omens.

**Significance in the Context of the Poem:**

*   **Intensification of Grief:** The simile elevates Venus's despair to an almost mythical, universal level. By comparing her reaction to the awe and terror of "the world's poor people" at "apparitions, signs, and prodigies," Shakespeare emphasizes the sheer enormity of her grief and terror. It's not just a personal loss, but an event that shakes her to her divine core, as profound as any portended disaster.
*   **Powerlessness in the Face of Fate/Death:** Despite being a goddess, Venus is utterly powerless against Adonis's fate and the unstoppable force of Death. Her "exclaim[ing] on Death" is a futile protest against an immutable power, mirroring the helplessness of the "poor people" before what they perceive as inevitable prophecies. This underscores one of the poem's central themes: the invincibility of death and the limitations of even divine power against it.
*   **Shift to Tragedy:** This stanza ushers in the tragic conclusion of the poem. The playful, seductive tone of Venus's earlier attempts to win Adonis is abruptly replaced by the harsh reality of mortality. It prepares the reader for Venus's extensive lamentations and the subsequent transformation of Adonis.
*   **Nature of Fear and Superstition:** The opening lines cleverly use the common human reaction to the unknown and the fearful interpretations of omens to establish a relatable framework for Venus's extraordinary divine sorrow. It suggests that even a goddess can experience a form of primal, instinctual dread akin to human superstition when faced with ultimate loss.
*   **Foreshadowing:** The "dreadful prophecies" attributed to omens subtly foreshadow the literal tragic outcome that Venus is now witnessing, linking the imagined terrors of superstition to the very real terror of Adonis's death.
