## üìñ Original Stanza
```
Look! how a bird lies tangled in a net,
So fasten‚Äôd in her arms Adonis lies;         
Pure shame and aw‚Äôd resistance made him fret,
Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes:
Rain added to a river that is rank
Perforce will force it overflow the bank.

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: Look! how a bird lies tangled in a net,
*   **"Look!"**: This imperative command directly addresses the reader, immediately drawing their attention to the vivid simile that follows. Shakespeare uses this to create a sense of immediacy and to immerse the reader in the visual comparison.
*   **"how a bird lies tangled in a net"**: This is a direct simile comparing Adonis to a helpless bird caught in a snare. The bird, typically a symbol of freedom and lightness, is rendered utterly vulnerable and trapped. Shakespeare chooses this image to emphasize Adonis's complete lack of agency and his passive, unwilling capture by Venus.
*   **Meaning:** "Observe how a bird is ensnared and helpless in a net," serving as an introductory comparison.

---

### Line 2: So fasten‚Äôd in her arms Adonis lies;
*   **"So fasten‚Äôd"**: This phrase directly links back to the preceding simile, explicitly stating the comparison. "Fasten'd" suggests being bound, secured, or held tightly against one's will, reinforcing the idea of captivity rather than a loving embrace. Shakespeare uses this word to highlight the involuntary nature of Adonis's situation.
*   **"in her arms"**: This refers to Venus's embrace, which is depicted not as affectionate but as a literal trap or constraint for Adonis.
*   **"Adonis lies"**: The verb "lies" emphasizes Adonis's passivity and immobility. He is not actively participating but is a victim of circumstances, pinned down and unable to escape. Shakespeare's choice of "lies" underscores his helplessness.
*   **Meaning:** "In the same manner, Adonis is held captive within Venus's arms."

---

### Line 3: Pure shame and aw‚Äôd resistance made him fret,
*   **"Pure shame"**: Adonis experiences intense humiliation and disgrace at being physically overpowered and subjected to Venus's unwanted advances. "Pure" emphasizes the unadulterated nature of this feeling, a profound blow to his pride and autonomy. Shakespeare highlights his wounded masculinity.
*   **"aw‚Äôd resistance"**: "Aw'd" here implies a resistance that is overwhelmed, intimidated, or subdued by the sheer force or divine power of Venus, or by the shocking nature of the situation. It suggests a resistance that is frustrated and largely ineffective, perhaps even tinged with a reluctant dread. Shakespeare uses this to show the internal conflict and the insurmountable odds Adonis faces.
*   **"made him fret"**: "Fret" means to chafe, worry, or be agitated and annoyed. This describes Adonis's internal turmoil, his deep discomfort, and his frustrated struggle against his predicament. Shakespeare uses "fret" to convey his intense psychological distress.
*   **Meaning:** "Profound humiliation and a resistance that was overwhelmed caused him intense agitation and frustration."

---

### Line 4: Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes:
*   **"Which bred"**: This means "which generated" or "which caused." The previous line's internal conflict and anger are directly linked as the cause of what follows.
*   **"more beauty"**: Paradoxically, Adonis's visible anger and distress only serve to heighten his attractiveness in Venus's eyes. This highlights Venus's predatory nature and her appreciation of his resistance as a form of sport or an enhancement to his allure, rather than a deterrent. Shakespeare uses this to expose the non-consensual dynamic and Venus's objectification of Adonis.
*   **"in his angry eyes"**: His anger is manifest in his gaze, yet it has an opposite effect on Venus than intended. It shows his internal state, which perversely fuels her desire. Shakespeare emphasizes the visual aspect of his beauty, even in displeasure.
*   **Meaning:** "His anger, visible in his eyes, paradoxically made him appear even more beautiful to her."

---

### Line 5: Rain added to a river that is rank
*   **"Rain added to"**: This begins a metaphorical comparison, where "rain" represents an additional force or stimulus. It is the catalyst in the subsequent action. Shakespeare prepares the reader for the inevitable consequence.
*   **"a river that is rank"**: Here, "rank" means full, abundant, swollen, or overflowing with growth, not foul-smelling. It describes a river already at or near its capacity, brimming. This sets up the natural consequence that follows. Shakespeare's choice of "rank" perfectly illustrates the state of Venus's already overwhelming passion.
*   **Meaning:** "Just as rain is added to a river that is already full and swollen,"

---

### Line 6: Perforce will force it overflow the bank.
*   **"Perforce"**: This archaic word means "by necessity" or "by force of circumstances." It indicates an unavoidable and inevitable outcome. Shakespeare uses it to emphasize the deterministic nature of the consequence.
*   **"will force it overflow the bank"**: This is the natural and inevitable result of adding more to something already at capacity. This line concludes the couplet, serving as a powerful allegory for Venus's desire. Adonis's resistance (the "rain") doesn't diminish Venus's passion (the "rank river"); instead, it intensifies it, causing it to "overflow the bank," meaning her desire becomes even more overwhelming and uncontrollable. Shakespeare uses this powerful image to illustrate the futility of Adonis's resistance in the face of Venus's insatiable lust.
*   **Meaning:** "It will inevitably cause that river to burst its banks and flood."

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza is pivotal in portraying the dynamic between Venus and Adonis. It vividly illustrates Adonis's predicament: he is utterly trapped and unwilling in Venus's embrace, likened to a bird ensnared in a net. His internal conflict, marked by "pure shame" and "aw'd resistance," leads to visible "fret" and anger. However, in a cruel paradox, his very resistance and discomfort only serve to enhance his beauty in Venus's eyes, further fueling her desire.

The concluding couplet acts as a powerful metaphorical summary of their interaction: Venus's passion is already like a "rank" (overflowing) river, and Adonis's "resistance" is the "rain" that, instead of quenching it, only causes it to burst its banks with even greater force. This signifies the futility of Adonis's struggle against the overwhelming and predatory nature of Venus's lust.

In the broader context of *Venus and Adonis*, this stanza underscores several key themes:
*   **Unwanted Desire vs. Chastity:** It starkly contrasts Venus's overwhelming, aggressive sexual desire with Adonis's youthful innocence, shame, and desire for purity and sport.
*   **Power Imbalance:** It highlights the immense power disparity between the divine goddess and the mortal youth, where Adonis is utterly subjugated despite his physical strength.
*   **Objectification:** Venus views Adonis not as an individual with agency, but as an object of her desire, where even his negative emotions are perceived as attractive. His resistance does not deter her but excites her further.
*   **Nature of Love/Lust:** The metaphor of the overflowing river suggests that unbridled passion, unchecked by consent or respect, becomes a destructive, overwhelming force that cannot be contained. This foreshadows the tragic outcome of Venus's pursuit.

The stanza thus solidifies the central conflict of the poem, emphasizing Adonis's vulnerability and Venus's relentless, almost perverse, pursuit, setting the stage for the escalating tension and the eventual tragic consequences.
