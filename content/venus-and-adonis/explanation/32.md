## üìñ Original Stanza
```
'Ay me,' quoth Venus, 'young, and so unkind!
What bare excuses mak'st thou to be gone!   
I'll sigh celestial breath, whose gentle wind
Shall cool the heat of this descending sun:
I'll make a shadow for thee of my hairs;  
If they burn too, I'll quench them with my tears.
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Analysis

### Line 1: "'Ay me,' quoth Venus, 'young, and so unkind!"
*   **"Ay me"**: An exclamation of distress or lamentation, similar to "alas" or "woe is me." Venus expresses her frustration and sorrow at Adonis's rejection.
*   **"quoth Venus"**: "Said Venus"‚Äîthe narrator's attribution, maintaining the formal, poetic tone.
*   **"young, and so unkind"**: A lament about the contradiction between Adonis's youth (which should be associated with passion and warmth) and his cruelty or coldness ("unkind"). "Unkind" means both harsh and unnatural‚Äîagainst his true nature.
*   **Meaning:** "Alas!' said Venus, 'you are so young, yet so cruel!"

---

### Line 2: "What bare excuses mak'st thou to be gone!"
*   **"What bare excuses"**: "Bare" means thin, inadequate, or insufficient. Venus dismisses Adonis's reasons for leaving as feeble and unconvincing.
*   **"mak'st thou"**: "Do you make"‚Äîarchaic second person singular form. The formal address continues despite her emotional distress.
*   **"to be gone"**: To leave, to depart from her presence. This shows Adonis is actively trying to escape her advances.
*   **Meaning:** "What weak excuses are you making to get away from me!"

---

### Line 3: "I'll sigh celestial breath, whose gentle wind"
*   **"I'll sigh celestial breath"**: Venus promises to breathe or sigh with divine breath‚Äîbefitting her status as a goddess. Her very sighs are "celestial," supernatural and powerful.
*   **"whose gentle wind"**: The breath from her sighs becomes a soft, cooling breeze. This transforms her emotional distress (sighing) into something beneficial for Adonis.
*   **Meaning:** "I will breathe divine sighs that create a gentle, cooling breeze"

---

### Line 4: "Shall cool the heat of this descending sun:"
*   **"Shall cool the heat"**: Her celestial breath will provide relief from the burning temperature. This continues her promise to care for his comfort.
*   **"this descending sun"**: The sun that is setting or moving toward the horizon. "Descending" suggests the sun is getting lower and perhaps more intense before sunset.
*   **Meaning:** "That will cool you from the heat of this setting sun:"

---

### Line 5: "I'll make a shadow for thee of my hairs;"
*   **"I'll make a shadow"**: Venus promises to create shade to protect Adonis from the sun's heat. This is a practical offer of physical comfort.
*   **"of my hairs"**: Using her own hair as the material for creating shade. This is both intimate (using part of her body) and suggests her hair is abundant and long enough to provide substantial coverage.
*   **Meaning:** "I'll create shade for you using my own hair;"

---

### Line 6: "If they burn too, I'll quench them with my tears."
*   **"If they burn too"**: If even her hair catches fire or becomes too hot from the sun. This shows the extremity of the heat and her willingness to sacrifice even more.
*   **"I'll quench them with my tears"**: She'll extinguish the flames with her own tears. This transforms her weeping (from emotional pain) into a practical solution for his physical discomfort.
*   **Meaning:** "If my hair catches fire too, I'll put it out with my tears."

## üéØ Overall Meaning & Significance in the Context of the Poem

This stanza shows Venus at her most maternal and self-sacrificing, responding to Adonis's complaint about the sun's heat with increasingly elaborate offers of protection and comfort. It represents a shift in her seductive strategy from sexual persuasion to nurturing care.

**From Seduction to Service**: Venus moves from trying to win Adonis through desire to attempting to win him through devotion and service. She offers her divine powers not for her own pleasure but for his comfort.

**Transformation of Suffering**: Venus ingeniously transforms her own emotional pain into practical solutions for Adonis's physical discomfort:
- Her sighs of frustration become cooling breezes
- Her abundant hair becomes protective shade  
- Her tears of sorrow become fire-quenching water

**Divine Power in Service of Love**: Venus demonstrates her supernatural abilities, but notably uses them in service rather than dominance. Her "celestial breath" and divine tears show she's willing to use her goddess powers as tools of care rather than conquest.

**Maternal vs. Sexual Love**: This stanza introduces a more maternal, protective aspect to Venus's love. Instead of aggressive seduction, she offers shelter, comfort, and protection‚Äîtraditionally maternal rather than sexual behaviors.

**Escalating Sacrifice**: The progression from breath to hair to tears shows increasing levels of self-sacrifice. Venus is willing to give progressively more intimate parts of herself for Adonis's comfort.

**The Futility of Devotion**: The irony is that Venus's increasing willingness to sacrifice everything for Adonis makes her less attractive to him, not more. Her desperation and self-abnegation actually repel rather than attract.

**Physical vs. Emotional Heat**: While Venus addresses Adonis's complaint about the sun's heat, she ignores the "heat" of her own passion that is the real source of his discomfort. She solves the wrong problem.

This stanza reveals the tragic nature of Venus's love‚Äîthe more she offers, the more Adonis wants to escape. Her divine powers, which should make her irresistible, become tools of desperate servitude that only emphasize the one-sided nature of their relationship. It shows how unrequited love can transform even a goddess into a figure of pathos rather than power.
