<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<h3>Line 1: At this Adonis smiles as in disdain,</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"At this"</strong>: Refers to the persistent and passionate advances, pleas, and arguments that Venus has just made to Adonis, seeking his affection.</li>
<li><strong>"Adonis smiles"</strong>: Indicates Adonis's reaction to Venus's ardent pursuit. It's not a smile of amusement or reciprocated interest, but a more complex, almost involuntary expression.</li>
<li><strong>"as in disdain"</strong>: Suggests that his smile is tinged with contempt, indifference, or a sense of superiority towards Venus's overtures. It conveys his youth's aloofness and disinterest in love, despite Venus being the goddess of it. Shakespeare uses "as in" to imply the <em>appearance</em> or <em>quality</em> of the disdain, making it less of an overt act and more a natural emanation of his youthful, unaffected nature.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> "Upon hearing Venus's advances, Adonis smiles as if with a look of scorn or indifference."</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 2: That in each cheek appears a pretty dimple:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"That"</strong>: Acts as a conjunction, connecting the smile to its immediate physical consequence; it's the result of his smile.</li>
<li><strong>"in each cheek appears"</strong>: Describes the physical manifestation of his smile, specifically the formation of dimples. This highlights his youthful, unspoiled beauty, which is so profound it even shines through his expression of disdain.</li>
<li><strong>"a pretty dimple"</strong>: Emphasizes the aesthetic appeal of this physical feature. "Pretty" is a simple yet powerful adjective that underscores Adonis's inherent beauty, making even his negative emotional display charming and captivating. The dimples are presented as an almost irresistible physical attribute.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> "As a result of his smile, a charming dimple becomes visible in each of his cheeks."</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 3: Love made those hollows, if himself were slain,</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Love made those hollows"</strong>: Personifies Love (either Cupid, the god of love, or the abstract concept of love itself) as the conscious creator of Adonis's dimples ("those hollows"). This implies that Adonis's beauty is divinely crafted or predestined to be an instrument or vessel for love, elevating a simple physical feature to a profound, almost sacred origin.</li>
<li><strong>"if himself were slain"</strong>: Introduces a hypothetical, paradoxical scenario. "Himself" refers to Love (the creator). The idea is that if Love were ever to be defeated or killed, there would be a specific place for its burial. This sets up the central conceit of the stanza, exploring where Love might find its end.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> "Love itself created those dimples, planning for them to be a burial place if Love were ever to be defeated or killed."</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 4: He might be buried in a tomb so simple;</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"He might be buried"</strong>: Continues the hypothetical scenario from the previous line, referring to Love (the personified entity). It implies a potential resting place for Love if its existence were to cease.</li>
<li><strong>"in a tomb so simple"</strong>: Metaphorically identifies Adonis's dimples as this potential "tomb." "Simple" describes the small, unadorned, and unassuming nature of a dimple, contrasting with the profound power attributed to it. The irony here is that a 'tomb' usually signifies death, but for Love, as the next lines reveal, it signifies something else entirely.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> "Love could potentially be interred in those small, uncomplicated hollows, as if in a tomb."</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 5: Foreknowing well, if there he came to lie,</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Foreknowing well"</strong>: Attributes a quality of prescience or divine foresight to Love (the creator of the dimples). This implies that Love intelligently planned this outcome. Love knew in advance the paradoxical power of the dimples.</li>
<li><strong>"if there he came to lie"</strong>: "There" refers back to the dimples (the "hollows" or "tomb"). "To lie" means to rest or be interred, continuing the imagery of burial.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> "For Love knew well in advance that if it were to come to rest in those dimples,"</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 6: Why, there Love liv‚Äôd, and there he could not die.</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Why, there Love liv‚Äôd"</strong>: This reveals the core paradox and the true nature of the dimples. Instead of being a place of death for Love, they are a place of eternal life. The 'tomb' becomes a cradle. "Why" emphasizes the surprising, almost logical, conclusion to the riddle.</li>
<li><strong>"and there he could not die"</strong>: Reinforces the previous statement, making the paradox absolute. Adonis's beauty, specifically his dimples, is so potent and inherently connected to Love that it renders Love immortal when resting within them. It suggests the dimples are not merely a place <em>for</em> Love, but are intrinsically <em>of</em> Love, an essence that prevents its demise.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> "Why, Love would not die there at all; instead, Love would actually live eternally in those dimples."</li>
</ul>

<h2>üéØ Overall Meaning &amp; Significance in the Context of the Poem</h2>
<p>This stanza serves as a profound testament to Adonis's almost divine and utterly captivating beauty, even in his youth and disdain. Despite his rejection of Venus's advances, his physical perfection, particularly the "pretty dimples" formed by his smile of scorn, is depicted as possessing an extraordinary power. The core meaning lies in the paradox that Adonis's beauty is not just attractive; it is so potent that it becomes the very source and eternal vessel for Love itself. The dimples, far from being a simple physical feature, are elevated to a sacred space where Love, if hypothetically "slain," would find not its end but its immortality.</p>
<p>In the broader context of the poem, this stanza is highly significant. It establishes the overwhelming nature of Adonis's allure, which even the goddess of love, Venus, cannot resist. It explains <em>why</em> Venus is so utterly consumed by her passion for him, despite his youth, disinterest, and even cruelty. The stanza suggests that Adonis, though unwilling, embodies Love in its purest, most powerful form. This sets up the central conflict: Venus, the embodiment of active, desiring love, is fixated on Adonis, who passively <em>is</em> love but refuses to <em>engage</em> with it. This dynamic foreshadows the tragic outcome, as such immense beauty and its inherent connection to Love cannot truly perish but will ultimately transform. It also subtly hints at the poem's underlying exploration of different facets of love ‚Äì passionate, unrequited, natural, and destructive ‚Äì and the immense power beauty holds over them all.</p>
