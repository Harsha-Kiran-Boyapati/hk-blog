<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<h3>Line 1: "Now which way shall she turn? what shall she say?"</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Now which way shall she turn?"</strong>: This is a rhetorical question that conveys Venus's profound disorientation, desperation, and lack of options. "Turn" can imply both a physical direction and a strategic shift in her approach, neither of which seems available to her. Shakespeare uses this to immediately establish her helplessness.</li>
<li><strong>"what shall she say?"</strong>: Another rhetorical question, highlighting that Venus, known for her captivating rhetoric and persuasive power, has exhausted all her arguments, pleas, and eloquent speeches. Her linguistic prowess, usually her strength, has utterly failed.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> At this moment, which path should she take, and what more can she possibly utter to convince him?</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 2: "Her words are done, her woes the more increasing;"</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Her words are done"</strong>: This directly answers the rhetorical question from the previous line. Venus has finished all her attempts at verbal persuasion, all her eloquent pleas and seductions have come to naught. "Done" signifies a complete exhaustion of her rhetorical arsenal.</li>
<li><strong>"her woes the more increasing"</strong>: Because her words have failed, her sorrow, suffering, and distress are intensifying. "Woes" refers to her profound emotional pain and the anguish of her rejection. Shakespeare uses "increasing" to show the escalating nature of her despair.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Her elaborate speeches and attempts at persuasion are finished, and as a direct result, her sorrow and suffering are only growing deeper.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 3: "The time is spent, her object will away,"</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"The time is spent"</strong>: The window of opportunity for Venus to sway Adonis has closed or is rapidly running out. This phrase conveys a sense of urgency, finality, and the inevitable passage of the moment.</li>
<li><strong>"her object will away"</strong>: "Her object" refers to Adonis, the person who is the focus of her desire and pursuit. "Will away" means he is determined to leave, or is on the verge of departing. This is a definitive statement of his imminent escape, crushing Venus's hopes.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> The moment she had to convince him is gone, and the person she desires is about to depart.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 4: "And from her twining arms doth urge releasing:"</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"And from her twining arms"</strong>: This vividly describes Venus's physical action of holding onto Adonis, with her arms wrapped tightly around him. "Twining" suggests a desperate, clinging, and perhaps even serpentine embrace, emphasizing her possessiveness and his feeling of being trapped.</li>
<li><strong>"doth urge releasing"</strong>: Adonis is actively and forcefully trying to free himself from her embrace. "Urge" implies a strong push or insistence, while "releasing" refers to his desire for liberation from her hold. This shows his resolve against her physical attempts to detain him.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> And he is forcefully trying to free himself from her arms, which are wrapped tightly around him.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 5: "‚ÄòPity,‚Äô she cries; ‚Äòsome favour, some remorse!‚Äô"</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"‚ÄòPity,‚Äô she cries;"</strong>: This is a direct quote of Venus's desperate, raw appeal. "Pity" is a plea for compassion and mercy, indicating her vulnerability and her shift from eloquent seduction to a primal cry for understanding. The verb "cries" emphasizes her emotional breakdown.</li>
<li><strong>"‚Äòsome favour, some remorse!‚Äô"</strong>: "Favour" means kindness or consideration, while "remorse" here means a feeling of compassion for her suffering or regret for his harshness. This is her last-ditch, unadorned plea for him to soften his stance and show some understanding or kindness before he leaves.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> "Have pity on me," she cries, "show me some kindness, some compassion!"</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 6: "Away he springs, and hasteth to his horse."</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Away he springs"</strong>: Describes Adonis's sudden, energetic, and resolute movement away from Venus. "Springs" suggests an abrupt, forceful, almost athletic leap, emphasizing his determination to escape her.</li>
<li><strong>"and hasteth to his horse"</strong>: He quickly hurries towards his horse, indicating his clear intention to leave immediately and resume his hunt. "Hasteth" (an archaic form of "hastens") reinforces his urgency and complete disinterest in Venus's advances, prioritizing his passion for the hunt.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> He suddenly leaps away from her and quickly hurries towards his horse.</li>
</ul>

<h2>üéØ Overall Meaning &amp; Significance in the Context of the Poem</h2>
<p>This stanza marks a pivotal moment in Shakespeare's <em>Venus and Adonis</em>, signifying the complete and utter failure of Venus's attempts to seduce, persuade, or even physically restrain Adonis. It functions as the climax of their direct interaction, immediately preceding his definitive departure.</p>
<p>The stanza's overall meaning emphasizes Venus's profound helplessness and desperation. Her legendary rhetorical prowess, which was showcased earlier in the poem with lengthy and elaborate speeches, has proven entirely ineffective against Adonis's youthful indifference and steadfast commitment to the hunt. The questions "Now which way shall she turn? what shall she say?" encapsulate her utter disorientation and the exhaustion of her resources, both verbal and emotional. Her final, fragmented cries of "Pity...some favour, some remorse!" underscore her descent from a powerful, eloquent goddess to a vulnerable, rejected figure, stripped of her dignity by unrequited desire.</p>
<p>In the broader context of the poem, this stanza is highly significant for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subversion of Mythological Roles:</strong> It powerfully demonstrates the reversal of traditional power dynamics. Venus, the goddess of love and beauty, is not only rejected by a mortal but is also shown in a position of complete powerlessness and humiliation. This challenges conventional portrayals of divine authority and effectiveness.</li>
<li><strong>The Folly of Unrequited Love/Lust:</strong> The stanza vividly portrays the pain, frustration, and loss of control that accompany unfulfilled desire. Venus's mounting "woes" and desperate clinging illustrate the destructive nature of obsession when faced with intractable indifference.</li>
<li><strong>Conflict Between Love and Chastity/Nature:</strong> Adonis's resolute escape and immediate return to his horse symbolize his firm rejection of Venus's amorous advances in favor of his natural pursuits (hunting) and a youthful, almost asexual, disinterest in love. This highlights the central thematic conflict between Venus's passionate, procreative love and Adonis's innocent, chaste nature, which ultimately leads to tragedy.</li>
<li><strong>The Uncontrollability of Desire:</strong> Even a goddess of love cannot force affection. The stanza underscores that desire, while powerful, cannot be commanded or imposed, reinforcing the idea that love, to be true, must be freely given.</li>
<li><strong>Foreshadowing of Tragedy:</strong> Adonis's swift departure, unyielding to Venus's pleas, subtly foreshadows his later tragic death during the hunt. His determination to prioritize his sport over love leads him away from Venus's protective influence and towards his fatal encounter with the boar.</li>
