<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<h3>Line 1: "Upon this promise did he raise his chin"</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Upon this promise"</strong>: Refers to a specific agreement or declaration made previously by Adonis, likely a reluctant concession or hint that he might reciprocate Venus's affection.</li>
<li><strong>"did he raise his chin"</strong>: This physical gesture signifies a moment of slight emergence, perhaps from shyness, defiance, or a momentary willingness to engage. It suggests he is momentarily overcoming his aversion.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> "Following a prior hint or promise he made, Adonis slightly lifted his chin."</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 2: "Like a dive-dapper peering through a wave,"</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Like a dive-dapper"</strong>: A simile comparing Adonis to a "dive-dapper," an archaic name for a small water bird (like a dabchick or grebe) known for its habit of quickly diving underwater and briefly resurfacing. Shakespeare chose this word to emphasize the bird's quick, elusive, and fleeting appearance.</li>
<li><strong>"peering through a wave"</strong>: Describes the bird's action of cautiously and momentarily poking its head above the water to look around. This highlights Adonis's cautious, fleeting, and non-committal engagement with Venus.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> "He did so in a manner similar to a small diving bird cautiously poking its head above a wave."</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 3: "Who, being look‚Äôd on, ducks as quickly in;"</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Who, being look‚Äôd on"</strong>: Refers to the dive-dapper bird, indicating that as soon as it is observed or noticed by someone. This implies Adonis's shyness or discomfort when his attention is met directly.</li>
<li><strong>"ducks as quickly in"</strong>: The bird's immediate reaction to being seen is to quickly submerge itself again. This illustrates Adonis's swift retreat from engagement or physical intimacy when Venus shows her eager reciprocation.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> "And just like that bird, upon being observed, he quickly withdraws again."</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 4: "So offers he to give what she did crave;"</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"So offers he"</strong>: "So" means "in this manner" or "thus." It connects Adonis's action to the preceding simile, emphasizing the cautious and temporary nature of his offer.</li>
<li><strong>"to give what she did crave"</strong>: Refers to the physical affection or kiss that Venus desires from Adonis, which she has been persistently seeking throughout the poem.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> "In this fleeting, hesitant way, he appears to offer the kiss or affection that Venus so deeply longed for."</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 5: "But when her lips were ready for his pay,"</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"But when her lips were ready"</strong>: Indicates Venus's immediate and eager response, her preparation for the kiss she anticipates.</li>
<li><strong>"for his pay"</strong>: This phrase uses a financial metaphor, suggesting that the kiss is a form of "payment" or reciprocal action for the promise or attention Adonis had briefly offered. It subtly casts the act of affection as a transaction, which Adonis ultimately refuses to complete. Shakespeare chose "pay" to underscore the unfulfilled expectation and perhaps a hint of Venus's feeling that she is owed this reciprocation.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> "But just as Venus's lips were prepared to receive the promised kiss from him,"</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 6: "He winks, and turns his lips another way."</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"He winks"</strong>: A mischievous, knowing, or perhaps even mocking gesture. It indicates a deliberate act of evasion, not just shyness. It shows a certain youthful trickery or defiance.</li>
<li><strong>"and turns his lips another way"</strong>: This is the ultimate act of refusal, a physical turning away to prevent the kiss. It confirms his complete lack of desire to engage physically with Venus.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> "He gives a playful wink and deliberately turns his face away, avoiding the kiss entirely."</li>
</ul>

<h2>üéØ Overall Meaning &amp; Significance in the Context of the Poem</h2>
<p>This stanza is pivotal in establishing the core dynamic between Venus and Adonis. It vividly portrays Adonis's profound reluctance towards physical intimacy and his almost childlike evasion of Venus's passionate advances. The extended simile of the "dive-dapper" bird is incredibly effective in capturing his fleeting appearance of compliance, immediately followed by a quick, deliberate withdrawal. This isn't just shyness; his "wink" suggests a knowing, almost mischievous, refusal, highlighting a cruel aspect of his youthful indifference.</p>
<p>In the broader context of Venus and Adonis, this stanza reinforces the central conflict: Venus's ardent, mature sexual desire versus Adonis's youthful, innocent aversion to love and his preference for the chase (of the hunt, not love). It underscores the theme of unrequited love and the frustration inherent in Venus's pursuit. Adonis's actions here are not merely a single rejection but a microcosm of his sustained coldness throughout the poem. The "pay" metaphor subtly introduces the idea of love as a transaction, which Adonis pointedly refuses to complete, further emphasizing his detachment and the poem's exploration of desire, pursuit, and the nature of beauty and physical attraction that is not reciprocated. This sets the stage for Venus's subsequent attempts at persuasion and seduction, all of which will ultimately fail due to Adonis's unyielding chastity and dedication to the hunt.</p>
