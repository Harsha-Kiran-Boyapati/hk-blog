<h2>üéØ Overall Meaning &amp; Significance in the Context of the Poem</h2>
<p>This stanza presents Venus's intimate physical examination of Adonis's corpse, showing her desperate attempt to find signs of life and her gradual acceptance of death's reality through sensory evidence.</p>
<p><strong>The Systematic Search for Life</strong>: Venus examines Adonis systematically‚Äîlips, hands, ears, eyes‚Äîas if conducting a medical examination to find any remaining spark of life. This shows her desperate denial of death's finality.</p>
<p><strong>The Sensory Reality of Death</strong>: Each sense confirms death's reality: sight shows paleness, touch reveals coldness, hearing gets no response, and vision finds only darkness. Venus must accept death through accumulated sensory evidence.</p>
<p><strong>The Treasure Metaphor</strong>: Calling eyelids "coffer-lids" transforms Adonis's eyes into precious treasures now locked away forever. This elevates his beauty to the level of valuable possessions that death has stolen.</p>
<p><strong>The Extinguished Light</strong>: The metaphor of eyes as "lamps, burnt out" suggests that Adonis was a source of illumination in the world‚Äîhis death has literally darkened the universe.</p>
<p><strong>Futile Communication</strong>: Venus's whispered "heavy tale" to dead ears shows her inability to accept that communication has ended. She still needs to speak to him even though he cannot hear.</p>
<p><strong>The Intimacy of Death</strong>: This physical examination is intensely intimate‚ÄîVenus touches and examines Adonis's body in death as she tried to do in life. Death has made him accessible in a way life never did.</p>
<p><strong>The Finality of Darkness</strong>: The progression from pale lips to cold hands to unresponsive ears to dark eyes creates a crescendo of death's completeness. Each detail confirms that life has fully departed.</p>
<p><strong>The Reversal of Seduction</strong>: Instead of trying to awaken desire, Venus now tries to awaken life itself. Her examination parallels her earlier seductive touches but serves the opposite purpose.</p>
<p><strong>The Physical Truth</strong>: After all her elaborate rhetoric and theories, Venus is confronted with the simple physical truth of death‚Äîcoldness, paleness, silence, and darkness.</p>
<p><strong>The Treasure Lost</strong>: The "coffer-lids" metaphor suggests that Adonis's eyes contained treasures of beauty that are now permanently locked away, making his death a cosmic robbery.</p>
<p>This stanza strips away all of Venus's elaborate explanations and theories, reducing her to the basic human experience of touching the dead and confirming through physical evidence that life has indeed ended.</p>
