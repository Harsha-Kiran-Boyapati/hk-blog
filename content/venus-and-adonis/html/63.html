<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<h3>Line 1: ‚ÄòGive me my hand,‚Äô saith he, ‚Äòwhy dost thou feel it?‚Äô</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"saith he"</strong>: Archaic form meaning "says he." This refers to Adonis, indicating his detachment and desire to withdraw from Venus's physical advances.</li>
<li><strong>"why dost thou feel it?"</strong>: Adonis's question reveals his innocence, discomfort, and lack of understanding regarding Venus's romantic intentions. He perceives her touch as a mere physical action rather than an expression of affection.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Adonis says, "Let go of my hand; why are you touching it?"</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 2: ‚ÄòGive me my heart,‚Äô saith she, ‚Äòand thou shalt have it;</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"saith she"</strong>: Archaic form meaning "says she." This refers to Venus, emphasizing her direct, passionate appeal to Adonis.</li>
<li><strong>"Give me my heart"</strong>: Venus is demanding Adonis's love, affection, and emotional commitment, not just his physical presence. "Heart" symbolizes the core of one's feelings and self.</li>
<li><strong>"and thou shalt have it"</strong>: Venus promises her own heart (love and devotion) in return for his. This highlights her expectation of reciprocity in love and her willingness to offer herself completely.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Venus replies, "Give me your love and affection, and you shall have mine in return for it."</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 3: O! give it me, lest thy hard heart do steel it,</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"O! give it me"</strong>: An emphatic and urgent plea from Venus, demonstrating her desperation and the intensity of her desire for Adonis's love.</li>
<li><strong>"lest thy hard heart do steel it"</strong>: "Lest" means "for fear that" or "in case." "Thy hard heart" refers to Adonis's emotional coldness and unresponsiveness. "Steel it" is a metaphor meaning to make it hard, unyielding, and impenetrable, like steel. Venus fears that Adonis's rejection will cause her own heart to become hardened and incapable of love. Shakespeare chose "steel" for its connotations of strength, coldness, and unbreakability, emphasizing the irreversible nature of her potential emotional state.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Oh, please give your love to me, for fear that your unfeeling heart will cause mine to become hard and unyielding.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 4: And being steel‚Äôd, soft sighs can never grave it:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"And being steel‚Äôd"</strong>: Refers to Venus's own heart, once it has been hardened by Adonis's rejection.</li>
<li><strong>"soft sighs"</strong>: Represents the gentle expressions of love, affection, or tender sorrow. These are emotions typically associated with the experience of love.</li>
<li><strong>"can never grave it"</strong>: "Grave" here means to engrave, impress, or mark deeply, as one would carve into stone or metal. If her heart becomes like steel, no gentle impression of love or compassion can be made upon it. This emphasizes the irreversible and insensate state her heart would enter.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> And once my heart has become as hard as steel, gentle expressions of love will never be able to make an impression upon it.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 5: Then love‚Äôs deep groans I never shall regard,</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"love‚Äôs deep groans"</strong>: Refers to the intense expressions of suffering, pain, or anguish associated with passionate love, especially unrequited love or tragic loss. These are more profound and severe than "soft sighs."</li>
<li><strong>"I never shall regard"</strong>: "Regard" means to pay attention to, care about, or feel compassion for. Venus warns that if her heart hardens, she will become indifferent to the intense suffering of others in love, implying even Adonis's potential future sorrow.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Then I will never pay attention to or care about the profound emotional suffering that comes with love.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 6: Because Adonis‚Äô heart hath made mine hard.‚Äô</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Adonis‚Äô heart"</strong>: Refers to Adonis's emotional coldness, his refusal to reciprocate Venus's love, and his overall unyielding nature.</li>
<li><strong>"hath made mine hard"</strong>: "Hath" is an archaic form of "has." Venus directly blames Adonis's lack of feeling for the potential hardening of her own heart. This line serves as a powerful accusation and a summary of the direct consequence of his rejection on her emotional state.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Because your unfeeling heart, Adonis, has caused my own heart to become cold and unresponsive.</li>
</ul>

<h2>üéØ Overall Meaning &amp; Significance in the Context of the Poem</h2>
<p>This stanza is a poignant and pivotal moment in Shakespeare's <em>Venus and Adonis</em>, encapsulating the central conflict and developing the character arcs. It moves beyond the earlier, more playful and persistent advances of Venus to a desperate plea and a stark warning about the consequences of unrequited love.</p>
<p>The core meaning revolves around the <strong>transformative power of love and rejection</strong>. Venus, the goddess of love, finds herself in an unprecedented position: her passionate advances are met with chilling indifference. Her plea for Adonis's "heart" in return for her own signifies the desired reciprocity of love‚Äîa concept Adonis, in his youthful innocence and aversion to adult passion, cannot grasp.</p>
<p>The most significant aspect of this stanza is the motif of the <strong>"hardening heart."</strong> Venus warns that Adonis's "hard heart" (his emotional coldness and refusal to engage) will, by osmosis, "steel" her own. This is a dramatic irony: the very embodiment of love risks becoming unfeeling due to its unreciprocated intensity. This hardening implies a loss of empathy and compassion, rendering her immune to "soft sighs" and "love's deep groans." This suggests that sustained rejection can wound even the most loving spirit, leading to a defensive emotional shutdown.</p>
<p>In the broader context of the poem, this stanza highlights:
*   <strong>The Power Dynamics of Desire:</strong> It underscores Adonis's unexpected power over Venus, despite her divine status and the force of her passion. His indifference proves more potent than her seductive wiles.
*   <strong>The Corruption of Innocence:</strong> While Adonis's heart is "hard" in its inexperience, Venus's potential hardening is a corruption of her very essence, foreshadowing the tragic consequences of such a clash between innocence and passion.
*   <strong>Foreshadowing and Pathos:</strong> Venus's lament serves as a subtle foreshadowing of Adonis's eventual death. Her warning that she "never shall regard" future "love's deep groans" adds a layer of pathos, suggesting that her capacity for empathy, even for Adonis's eventual suffering, might be irrevocably damaged by his present cruelty.
*   <strong>The Destructive Nature of Unrequited Love:</strong> Beyond merely causing pain to the lover, the stanza suggests that unrequited love can fundamentally alter the beloved's capacity to love or even to empathize with love's pain, creating a cycle of emotional sterility.</p>
<p>Ultimately, stanza 63 intensifies the tragic undertones of the poem, portraying love not just as a source of joy and life, but also as a potentially destructive force when met with rejection, capable of hardening hearts and stifling compassion.</p>
