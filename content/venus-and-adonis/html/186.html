<h2>üéØ Overall Meaning &amp; Significance in the Context of the Poem</h2>
<p>This stanza completes Venus's reinterpretation of Adonis's death, transforming it from a hunting accident into a tragic love story where the boar's affection proves fatal due to his dangerous nature.</p>
<p><strong>The Complete Role Reversal</strong>: Venus presents Adonis as the aggressor who "ran upon the boar with his sharp spear," while the boar is peaceful, choosing "a kiss" over violence. This completely inverts the expected narrative of dangerous beast versus innocent youth.</p>
<p><strong>Love as Unintentional Destroyer</strong>: The boar becomes "the loving swine" whose affection is accidentally fatal. This reflects Venus's own situation‚Äîher love was overwhelming and potentially destructive to Adonis.</p>
<p><strong>The Unconscious Fatal Act</strong>: "Sheath'd unaware" suggests the boar had no intention of killing, making the death a tragic accident of love rather than predatory violence. The tusk penetrates "unaware," making physical love literally deadly.</p>
<p><strong>Anatomical Intimacy</strong>: The specific reference to the "soft groin" makes the wound both sexually suggestive and vulnerably human. The boar's tusk penetrates the most intimate and vulnerable part of Adonis's body.</p>
<p><strong>Venus's Self-Justification</strong>: By making the boar's love fatal, Venus creates a parallel to her own aggressive pursuit of Adonis. Both she and the boar overwhelmed their object of desire with unwanted affection.</p>
<p><strong>The Paradox of Nuzzling</strong>: "Nuzzling" is the tenderest form of animal affection, yet it becomes the vehicle for death. This shows how even the gentlest expressions of love can be dangerous when the lover is physically threatening.</p>
<p><strong>Repetitive Conviction</strong>: "'Tis true, 'tis true" shows Venus desperately convincing herself that this romantic interpretation is correct, revealing her psychological need to find love even in death.</p>
<p><strong>The Problem of Physical Incompatibility</strong>: The boar's tusks make him inherently dangerous regardless of his intentions, reflecting how some forms of love are structurally impossible due to physical or temperamental incompatibility.</p>
<p><strong>Death Through Intimacy</strong>: The fatal wound occurs during an intimate embrace ("nuzzling"), making death the direct result of attempted closeness rather than distance or hostility.</p>
<p><strong>The Mirror of Venus's Love</strong>: The boar's fatal affection mirrors Venus's own overwhelming love for Adonis‚Äîwell-intentioned but destructive, loving but ultimately deadly to its object.</p>
<p>This stanza represents Venus's final psychological defense against the reality of senseless loss, transforming even the agent of destruction into a fellow lover whose only crime was loving too dangerously.</p>
