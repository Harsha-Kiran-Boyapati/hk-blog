<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<h3>Line 1: Upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly,</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Upon his hurt"</strong>: Refers to the severe injury Adonis has sustained from the boar. "Hurt" is used here to denote the wound itself.</li>
<li><strong>"steadfastly"</strong>: This adverb means with fixed, unwavering attention and concentration. Shakespeare chooses this word to emphasize the intense, unblinking focus Venus applies to the horrific sight, indicating her deep shock and overwhelming grief.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Venus stares intently and without flinching at his fatal wound.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 2: That her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three;</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"her sight dazzling"</strong>: This phrase suggests a blurring or distortion of vision, not from bright light but from extreme emotional distress (grief, shock, perhaps tears welling up). Her visual perception is overwhelmed and compromised. Shakespeare uses "dazzling" to convey a sense of being overcome or overwhelmed, leading to visual confusion.</li>
<li><strong>"makes the wound seem three"</strong>: Her distorted, distressed vision causes the single wound to appear multiplied, specifically as three distinct wounds. This is an exaggeration that powerfully conveys the horror and psychological impact of the sight on Venus, making the tragedy even more profound for her.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Her vision, blurred and overwhelmed by intense emotion, makes the single wound appear to be three separate ones.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 3: And then she reprehends her mangling eye,</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"reprehends"</strong>: To reprimand, scold, or find fault with. Venus is so distraught that she literally blames and scolds her own eye.</li>
<li><strong>"her mangling eye"</strong>: Her eye that is distorting or disfiguring what she sees. "Mangle" typically means to severely disfigure or tear, and here Shakespeare personifies the eye, attributing to it an active, almost malicious role in 'mangling' or corrupting her perception by multiplying the injury, thereby intensifying her suffering.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> And then, in her distress, she scolds her own eye for distorting reality.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 4: That makes more gashes where no breach should be:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"makes more gashes"</strong>: Her eye creates the illusion of additional deep cuts or wounds beyond the original. "Gashes" are long, deep cuts.</li>
<li><strong>"where no breach should be"</strong>: This refers to the parts of Adonis's body that are otherwise untouched and uninjured, or implies that there should be no more wounds than the one, or ideally, no wounds at all. "Breach" here means an opening, a cut, or a wound. Shakespeare emphasizes the eye's cruel 'creation' of phantom injuries on Adonis's perfect form.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Her eye creates the illusion of more deep cuts in places where there should be no additional wounds.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 5: His face seems twain, each several limb is doubled;</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"His face seems twain"</strong>: Adonis's face appears to Venus as two separate faces. "Twain" is an archaic word meaning two. This continues the theme of extreme visual distortion affecting her entire perception of his body.</li>
<li><strong>"each several limb is doubled"</strong>: Every individual limb (arm, leg) appears to be two, reinforcing the complete breakdown of her visual processing. "Several" here means distinct or individual. Shakespeare extends the visual hallucination to Adonis's entire body, illustrating the overwhelming nature of Venus's shock.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> His face appears to be two faces, and every one of his limbs seems to be duplicated.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 6: For oft the eye mistakes, the brain being troubled.</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"For oft the eye mistakes"</strong>: This provides a general, universal explanation for the specific phenomenon Venus is experiencing. "Oft" means often. It suggests that such optical illusions are common.</li>
<li><strong>"the brain being troubled"</strong>: When the mind or emotions are disturbed, distressed, or overwhelmed by grief, fear, or other intense feelings. Shakespeare articulates a profound psychological insight: extreme emotional distress directly impacts and distorts one's perception of reality.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Because the eye often makes errors in perception when the mind or emotions are deeply disturbed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>üéØ Overall Meaning &amp; Significance in the Context of the Poem</h2>
<p>This stanza is a powerful depiction of the immediate aftermath of Adonis's death, focusing entirely on Venus's profound and overwhelming grief. It moves beyond a mere description of her sorrow to illustrate its physical and psychological effects. The core meaning is that extreme emotional trauma can so profoundly disturb the mind that it distorts one's very perception of reality. Venus's "troubled brain" causes her "eye" to "mistake," multiplying Adonis's single wound and duplicating his features. This vividly conveys the depth of her shock and despair, rendering her perception unreliable and adding to the horror of the scene.</p>
<p>In the broader context of <em>Venus and Adonis</em>, this stanza is highly significant. It marks the tragic culmination of the poem's central conflict between Venus's passionate, life-affirming love and Adonis's cold, death-driven pursuit of the hunt. Her unrequited love now transforms into unbearable sorrow. The stanza reinforces themes of loss, the destructive power of obsession (both Venus's love and Adonis's hunting), and the fragility of beauty. Adonis, who resisted love, is now reduced to a mangled corpse, and even his image is further "mangled" by Venus's grieving perception. It underscores the ultimate futility and pain that result from the clashing desires, solidifying the poem's tragic tone and setting the stage for Venus's lament and transformation of Adonis into a flower. The universal truth articulated in the final line about the mind's influence on perception also elevates the personal tragedy to a more universal human experience of grief.</p>
