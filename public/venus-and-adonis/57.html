<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<h3>Line 1: "He sees her coming, and begins to glow,--"</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"He sees her coming"</strong>: Adonis observes Venus approaching him.</li>
<li><strong>"begins to glow"</strong>: This indicates a physical manifestation of an internal emotional reaction. Given the subsequent description of his anger, it suggests a flush or reddening of the face, not from passion or warmth, but from irritation, annoyance, or a suppressed anger. Shakespeare often uses "glow" for intense, burning emotions, whether positive or negative.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Adonis sees Venus approaching him and his face begins to redden or flush, signaling a strong internal reaction.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 2: "Even as a dying coal revives with wind,--"</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Even as"</strong>: This introduces a simile, comparing Adonis's reaction to the behavior of a dying coal.</li>
<li><strong>"a dying coal"</strong>: Refers to an ember that is nearly extinguished, still holding some latent heat but not actively burning.</li>
<li><strong>"revives with wind"</strong>: The wind, instead of putting out the ember, causes it to flare up, glow more intensely, or even burst into flame. This implies that Adonis's pre-existing, perhaps latent, negative feelings (aversion, annoyance) are intensified and brought to the surface by Venus's arrival, rather than being extinguished or ignored.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> His internal feeling, like a nearly extinguished ember, intensifies dramatically and becomes more apparent upon her approach, as if fanned by wind.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 3: "And with his bonnet hides his angry brow;"</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"bonnet"</strong>: A type of hat, worn by men and women in Shakespeare's time.</li>
<li><strong>"hides his angry brow"</strong>: He pulls his hat down over his forehead to conceal his facial expression, specifically the furrowing or contortion of his brow that would reveal his anger or displeasure. This is a deliberate action of concealment and rejection.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> He pulls his hat low over his face to hide the visible signs of anger on his forehead.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 4: "Looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind,"</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Looks on the dull earth"</strong>: He directs his gaze downwards, avoiding eye contact with Venus. "Dull earth" emphasizes his disinterest in his immediate surroundings and perhaps his internal state of boredom, indifference, or annoyance towards Venus, which makes everything else seem uninteresting.</li>
<li><strong>"with disturbed mind"</strong>: His thoughts are troubled, agitated, or unsettled. He is clearly not at ease, and Venus's presence has caused him mental distress.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> He stares down at the uninteresting ground, his thoughts troubled and agitated by her presence.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 5: "Taking no notice that she is so nigh,"</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Taking no notice"</strong>: He pretends not to acknowledge her presence or her closeness, a deliberate act of feigned ignorance and indifference.</li>
<li><strong>"nigh"</strong>: An archaic word meaning "near" or "close by."</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> He deliberately acts as if he doesn't notice that she is so very close to him.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 6: "For all askance he holds her in his eye."</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"For all askance"</strong>: This phrase means "because, despite his pretense, he is actually looking sidelong or indirectly." "Askance" implies a look of disapproval, suspicion, or distrust.</li>
<li><strong>"he holds her in his eye"</strong>: He keeps her within his field of vision, observing her movements without directly engaging or making eye contact. This reveals the hypocrisy of his previous line ‚Äì he <em>is</em> paying attention, but with an unfriendly gaze.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Because, despite his feigned indifference, he is actually watching her indirectly with a sidelong glance of disapproval or suspicion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>üéØ Overall Meaning &amp; Significance in the Context of the Poem</h2>
<p>Stanza 57 is pivotal in establishing Adonis's character and his immediate, visceral reaction to Venus's ardent pursuit. It fundamentally shapes the central conflict of the poem: the clash between insatiable desire (Venus) and reluctant chastity/disinterest (Adonis).</p>
<p>Firstly, the stanza emphatically clarifies that Adonis's lack of reciprocation is not merely youthful shyness or innocence, but an active, profound aversion. The "dying coal" simile is crucial; it suggests that his anger or discomfort isn't newly kindled but a pre-existing, perhaps latent, feeling that Venus's approach intensifies. His attempts to "hide his angry brow" and his "disturbed mind" clearly indicate a deep-seated annoyance and distress, rather than mere indifference.</p>
<p>Secondly, the contrast between his feigned ignorance ("Taking no notice") and his covert observation ("For all askance he holds her in his eye") reveals his guarded nature and a deliberate, conscious effort to repel Venus. He is fully aware of her presence and actively chooses to ignore her, even as he keeps a wary eye on her. This shows a young man fully capable of making his own choices, rejecting the role of passive object of desire.</p>
<p>This stanza sets the stage for the rest of the poem, where Venus's persistent advances meet Adonis's unwavering resistance. It foreshadows the tragic outcome, as Adonis's deep-seated discomfort with Venus's all-consuming passion ultimately leads him to seek escape in the dangerous hunt, culminating in his death. The stanza powerfully underscores the poem's broader themes of the destructive nature of unrequited love, the conflict between lust and chastity, and the inability of passion to compel affection where it does not naturally exist. It portrays Adonis not just as a beautiful youth, but as an individual with agency, whose internal world is profoundly disturbed by the predatory nature of Venus's desire.</p>
