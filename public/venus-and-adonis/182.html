<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<h3>Line 1: "And therefore would he put his bonnet on,"</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"And therefore"</strong>: Connects this action to Adonis's ongoing attempts to avoid Venus's persistent advances and amorous gaze, implying this is a consequence of his desire for privacy or escape.</li>
<li><strong>"would he put his bonnet on"</strong>: Adonis's deliberate action to don a hat (a bonnet) signifies his attempt to conceal himself, his modesty, or his desire to shield himself from Venus's passionate scrutiny. Shakespeare uses "bonnet" to denote a simple head covering, emphasizing Adonis's innocent desire for a barrier.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> "And for this reason, he would put his hat on."</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 2: "Under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep;"</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Under whose brim"</strong>: Refers to the edge of the bonnet, creating a small, shadowed space.</li>
<li><strong>"the gaudy sun"</strong>: "Gaudy" here means showy, excessively bright, or perhaps ostentatious. Shakespeare personifies the sun as a persistent, curious entity, much like Venus herself. The sun's brightness parallels Venus's overwhelming passion and her inability to look away from Adonis's beauty.</li>
<li><strong>"would peep"</strong>: Implies a furtive or sly glance, suggesting the sun's (and by extension, Venus's) insatiable desire to catch a glimpse of Adonis's beauty, even when he tries to hide.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> "Beneath the brim of his hat, the bright, showy sun would try to peek at him."</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 3: "The wind would blow it off, and, being gone,"</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"The wind would blow it off"</strong>: An external, natural force intervenes, thwarting Adonis's attempt at concealment. This symbolizes the irresistible forces (perhaps even Cupid's influence, or fate, or simply the relentless power of nature and beauty) that conspire against Adonis's will to remain hidden.</li>
<li><strong>"and, being gone"</strong>: The bonnet has been removed, leaving Adonis exposed once more.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> "Then the wind would blow his hat off, and once it was gone,"</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 4: "Play with his locks: then would Adonis weep;"</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Play with his locks"</strong>: The wind, now that the hat is off, gently yet sensuously toys with Adonis's hair ("locks"). This act of exposure further emphasizes Adonis's vulnerability and irresistible beauty, making him even more desirable. Shakespeare uses "play" to suggest a tender, almost seductive interaction.</li>
<li><strong>"then would Adonis weep"</strong>: Adonis's emotional reaction to being exposed and having his attempts at privacy frustrated. His tears signify his distress, helplessness, and perhaps the overwhelming pressure he feels from Venus's advances and the forces that conspire against his will.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> "The wind would then gently play with his hair; at this, Adonis would begin to cry."</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 5: "And straight, in pity of his tender years,"</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"And straight"</strong>: Immediately, without delay.</li>
<li><strong>"in pity of his tender years"</strong>: Refers to the instant compassion evoked by Adonis's youth and distress. "Tender years" highlights his innocence, vulnerability, and immaturity, making his tears seem all the more poignant and deserving of comfort.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> "And immediately, out of sympathy for his young age,"</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 6: "They both would strive who first should dry his tears."</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"They both"</strong>: This likely refers to Venus (the primary agent in the poem) and the personified "pity" itself, or perhaps Venus using both her hands/efforts, as if two entities are working together. It emphasizes the collective and urgent desire to alleviate Adonis's distress.</li>
<li><strong>"would strive who first should dry his tears"</strong>: Highlights the competitive eagerness to comfort Adonis, underscoring the intense longing to soothe him. This shows Venus's dual nature: she pursues him relentlessly, but also desires to alleviate his suffering, even if it's suffering caused by her own pursuit.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> "Both Venus and the feeling of pity would compete to see who could dry his tears first."</li>
</ul>

<h2>üéØ Overall Meaning &amp; Significance in the Context of the Poem</h2>
<p>This stanza is pivotal in portraying the dynamic between Venus and Adonis. It vividly illustrates Adonis's overwhelming desire for autonomy and escape from Venus's passionate advances. His act of putting on a "bonnet" signifies his innocence and his futile attempts to shield himself from the relentless gaze of desire, represented by the "gaudy sun" and the playful yet revealing "wind." His weeping is not merely an infantile outburst but a powerful expression of his profound discomfort and helplessness in the face of Venus's ardent pursuit, which strips him of his control and privacy.</p>
<p>The stanza's significance lies in its depiction of:
*   <strong>Adonis's vulnerability and resistance:</strong> He is not a willing participant in Venus's passion; his actions (hiding, weeping) consistently convey his aversion to her advances, emphasizing his youth and innocence ("tender years").
*   <strong>Venus's inescapable power and dual nature:</strong> Even when Adonis attempts to hide, external forces (like the wind and sun, which can be seen as extensions of Venus's overwhelming influence or the natural order she embodies) conspire to expose him. Her immediate desire to comfort him ("strive who first should dry his tears") showcases her complex character ‚Äì she is both the cause of his distress and the eager comforter, highlighting the paradox of love's pursuit.
*   <strong>The theme of control and lack thereof:</strong> Adonis constantly tries to control his environment and his body, but natural forces and Venus's passion repeatedly thwart him, demonstrating his lack of agency in this amorous contest.
*   <strong>The essence of unrequited love/desire:</strong> Adonis's tears and efforts to hide encapsulate the pain and discomfort of being the object of unwanted desire, a central theme in the poem. Venus's eagerness to comfort him, even after causing his distress, reinforces her obsessive devotion, regardless of his feelings.</p>
<p>This stanza underscores the core conflict of <em>Venus and Adonis</em>: the clash between Venus's mature, insatiable desire and Adonis's youthful, innocent aversion, framed within the beautiful yet often overwhelming power of nature.</p>
