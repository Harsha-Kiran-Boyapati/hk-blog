<h2>üîç Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>
<h3>Line 1: "Sometimes she shakes her head, and then his hand;"</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"shakes her head"</strong>: This gesture conveys Venus's internal reaction, possibly exasperation, disbelief, or frustration at Adonis's continued coldness or youthful naivety regarding her advances.</li>
<li><strong>"then his hand"</strong>: Immediately following her internal reaction, she attempts to establish physical contact by reaching for or grasping his hand, signaling her persistent desire for connection and her active pursuit of him.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> At times, she shakes her head in exasperation or disbelief, and then she reaches out to grasp his hand.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 2: "Now gazeth she on him, now on the ground;"</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"gazeth"</strong>: To look intently or with a fixed stare. This implies a deep, lingering gaze filled with longing, desire, or perhaps a hint of desperation.</li>
<li><strong>"on him"</strong>: Her direct object of desire, highlighting her intense focus on Adonis.</li>
<li><strong>"now on the ground"</strong>: This shift in gaze indicates a moment of withdrawal, perhaps out of shyness, frustration, despair, or contemplation. It suggests a temporary retreat from her direct pursuit, possibly due to his unresponsiveness.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> At one moment, she stares intently at him, and at the next, she casts her gaze downwards to the ground.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 3: "Sometimes her arms infold him like a band:"</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"infold"</strong>: To wrap around, embrace, or encircle tightly. It denotes a possessive and encompassing action.</li>
<li><strong>"like a band"</strong>: This simile emphasizes the restrictive and binding nature of her embrace. A "band" implies something that holds tightly, almost like a restraint or a binding strap, highlighting the coercive aspect of her affection rather than a gentle embrace.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> At other times, she wraps her arms around him tightly, as if she were binding him with a strap or rope.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 4: "She would, he will not in her arms be bound;"</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"She would"</strong>: This phrase succinctly expresses Venus's strong desire or wish ‚Äì she wants him to be held and possessed by her.</li>
<li><strong>"he will not"</strong>: This provides a stark contrast, representing Adonis's resolute refusal and active resistance to her desires, highlighting his autonomy and aversion to her advances.</li>
<li><strong>"in her arms be bound"</strong>: Directly references the previous line's simile ("like a band"), explicitly stating her intention to hold him captive and his unwillingness to be confined by her embrace.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> She intensely desires for him to be held captive in her embrace, but he adamantly refuses to be restrained by her arms.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 5: "And when from thence he struggles to be gone,"</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"from thence"</strong>: From that place, specifically from her restrictive embrace.</li>
<li><strong>"struggles to be gone"</strong>: This vividly portrays Adonis's active and physical effort to escape. It emphasizes his discomfort and his forceful resistance, showing that he is not merely passive but actively trying to free himself.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> And when he physically struggles to free himself from her embrace and leave,</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Line 6: "She locks her lily fingers one in one."</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"locks"</strong>: To intertwine or interlace tightly, indicating a firm and determined grip. This action reinforces her attempt to hold him despite his struggle.</li>
<li><strong>"lily fingers"</strong>: "Lily" symbolizes purity, whiteness, and delicate beauty. The term here highlights Venus's physical attractiveness, creating a striking contrast between her beautiful, delicate hands and the forceful, almost desperate action of "locking" them.</li>
<li><strong>"one in one"</strong>: Refers to her fingers being tightly interlocked, either around Adonis to strengthen her hold on him, or possibly around each other in a desperate attempt to reinforce her grip or contain her own surging desire. Given the context of his struggle, it suggests a tightening of her embrace on him.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> She tightly interlaces her beautiful, pale fingers (to strengthen her hold on him or in a gesture of desperation).</li>
</ul>

<h2>üéØ Overall Meaning &amp; Significance in the Context of the Poem</h2>
<p>This stanza offers a powerful and intimate portrayal of Venus's relentless and increasingly physical pursuit of Adonis, juxtaposed against his steadfast resistance. It vividly illustrates the escalating tension between desire and aversion. Each line details a different facet of Venus's approach, from subtle gestures of frustration (shaking her head) and longing (gazing) to overtly aggressive and binding embraces ("infold him like a band," "locks her lily fingers"). The clear contrast between her passionate will ("She would") and his firm refusal ("he will not") underscores the central conflict of unrequited love and the power imbalance between the goddess and the mortal. Adonis's "struggles to be gone" highlight his active discomfort and his fervent desire for freedom, positioning him as a reluctant victim rather than a willing participant.</p>
<p>In the broader context of <em>Venus and Adonis</em>, this stanza is highly significant as it amplifies the poem's core themes of sexual desire versus youthful innocence, and the often-coercive nature of passionate love when unchecked. The imagery of Venus holding Adonis "like a band" and trying to keep him "bound" foreshadows the suffocating and ultimately tragic consequences of her relentless pursuit. It de-romanticizes her desire, revealing it as a force that can imprison rather than liberate. The beautiful "lily fingers" being used to "lock" him creates a striking paradox, suggesting that even beauty and love can become tools of entrapment. This stanza thus deepens the poem's exploration of desire as a powerful, sometimes destructive, force that disregards personal autonomy, laying groundwork for Adonis's ultimate escape into death rather than submission to Venus.</p>
